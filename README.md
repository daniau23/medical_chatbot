### **Medical ChatBot**

This project shows the use of Langchain's RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain and a safety prompt for the retrieval of relevant information from sourced documents.

If a harmful question is asked, it is caught and notifies the user that such a prompt is not allowed.

Why use article_parser? For better RAG results
