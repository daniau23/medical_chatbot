      "\n",
      "Measles is a highly contagious, serious airborne disease caused by a virus that can lead to severe complications and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles vaccination averted 57 million deaths being between 2000 and 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available, in 2022, there were an estimated 136 000 measles deaths globally, mostly among unvaccinated or under vaccinated children under the age of 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proportion of children receiving a first dose of measles vaccine was 83% in 2023, well below the 2019 level of 86%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles can affect anyone but is most common in children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "An estimated 136 000 people died from measles in 2022 – mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 57 million deaths between 2000–2022. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 761 000 in 2000 to 136 000 in 2022 (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "All children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention\n",
      "\n",
      "Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12–15 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15–18 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella.\n",
      "\n",
      "Routine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$ 1 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb.\n",
      "\n",

      "Measles is a highly contagious, serious airborne disease caused by a virus that can lead to severe complications and death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles vaccination averted 57 million deaths being between 2000 and 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available, in 2022, there were an estimated 136 000 measles deaths globally, mostly among unvaccinated or under vaccinated children under the age of 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proportion of children receiving a first dose of measles vaccine was 83% in 2023, well below the 2019 level of 86%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles can affect anyone but is most common in children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "An estimated 136 000 people died from measles in 2022 – mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 57 million deaths between 2000–2022. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 761 000 in 2000 to 136 000 in 2022 (1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "Doctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "All children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention\n",
      "\n",
      "Community-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12–15 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15–18 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella.\n",
      "\n",
      "Routine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$ 1 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as not all children develop immunity from the first dose.\n",
