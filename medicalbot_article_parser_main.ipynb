      "To reduce the risk of getting or spreading hepatitis B, practice safe sex by using condoms and reducing the number of sexual partners, avoid sharing needles or any equipment used for injecting drugs, piercing, or tattooing, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after coming into contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces, and get a hepatitis B vaccine if working in a healthcare setting. HIV causes other infections to get worse, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and mpox. HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery. People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. People living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission. Risk factors for HIV include having anal or vaginal sex without a condom, having another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis, harmful use of alcohol or drugs in the context of sexual behaviour, sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, or drug solutions when injecting drugs, receiving unsafe infections, blood transfusions, or tissue transplantation, and medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; or accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers. Diagnosis of HIV can be done through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm. Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 57 million deaths between 2000–2022. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 761 000 in 2000 to 136 000 in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic led to setbacks in surveillance and immunization efforts, and the suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.\n",

      "Asthma can be identified through a combination of symptoms, physical examinations, and diagnostic tests. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. A physical examination may reveal signs such as increased respiratory rate or use of accessory muscles during breathing. Diagnostic tests such as spirometry, peak flow meter readings, and chest X-rays can help confirm the diagnosis. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n",

      "Measles can be prevented through vaccination. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against these viruses.
