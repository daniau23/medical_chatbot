      "['Title:Malaria\\n\\nArticle:\\n\\nKey facts\\n\\nGlobally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608 000 malaria deaths in 85 countries.\\n\\nThe WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden.\\n\\nIn 2022, the Region was home to 94% of malaria cases (233 million) and 95% (580 000) of malaria deaths.\\n\\nChildren under 5 accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in the Region.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nMalaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.\\n\\nThe infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.\\n\\nInfants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.\\n\\nMalaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.\\n\\nThere are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.', 'Symptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\\n\\nSymptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk. Severe symptoms include:\\n\\nextreme tiredness and fatigue\\n\\nimpaired consciousness\\n\\nmultiple convulsions\\n\\ndifficulty breathing\\n\\ndark or bloody urine\\n\\njaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin)\\n\\nabnormal bleeding.\\n\\nPeople with severe symptoms should get emergency care right away. Getting treatment early for mild malaria can stop the infection from becoming severe.\\n\\nMalaria infection during pregnancy can also cause premature delivery or delivery of a baby with low birth weight.\\n\\nDisease burden\\n\\nAccording to the latest World malaria report, there were 249 million cases of malaria in 2022 compared to 244 million cases in 2021. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 608 000 in 2022 compared to 610 000 in 2021.\\n\\nThe WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2022 the Region was home to about 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 78% of all malaria deaths in the Region.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nFour African countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (26.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%) and Mozambique (4.2%).\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.\\n\\n\\n\\nLower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:', 'Prevention\\n\\nFour African countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (26.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%) and Mozambique (4.2%).\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.\\n\\n\\n\\nLower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:\\n\\nUse mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present\\n\\nUse mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) after dusk\\n\\nUse coils and vaporizers.\\n\\nWear protective clothing.\\n\\nUse window screens.\\n\\nVector control\\n\\nVector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).\\n\\nProgress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among Anopheles mosquitoes. As described in the latest World malaria report, other threats to ITNs include insufficient access, loss of nets due to the stresses of day-to-day life outpacing replacement, and changing behaviour of mosquitoes, which appear to be biting early before people go to bed and resting outdoors, thereby evading exposure to insecticides.\\n\\nChemoprophylaxis\\n\\nTravellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period.', 'Preventive chemotherapies\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines.\\n\\nVaccine\\n\\nSince October 2021, WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M. The availability of two malaria vaccines is expected to make broad-scale deployment across Africa possible.\\n\\nQuestions and answers on the RTS,S vaccine.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease, prevents deaths and contributes to reducing transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based diagnostic testing (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test).\\n\\n\\n\\nMalaria is a serious infection and always requires treatment with medicine.\\n\\n\\n\\nMultiple medicines are used to prevent and treat malaria. Doctors will choose one or more based on:\\n\\nthe type of malaria', 'Treatment\\n\\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease, prevents deaths and contributes to reducing transmission.

Doctors will choose one or more based on:\\n\\nthe type of malaria\\n\\nwhether a malaria parasite is resistant to a medicine\\n\\nthe weight or age of the person infected with malaria\\n\\nwhether the person is pregnant.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese are the most common medicines for malaria:\\n\\nArtemisinin-based combination therapy medicines are the most effective treatment for P. falciparum malaria.\\n\\nChloroquine is recommended for treatment of infection with the P. vivax parasite only in places where it is still sensitive to this medicine.\\n\\nPrimaquine should be added to the main treatment to prevent relapses of infection with the P. vivax and P. ovale parasites.\\n\\nMost medicines used are in pill form.

WHO is very concerned about reports of partial artemisinin resistance in Africa, confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and, most recently, Tanzania. Regular monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance.\\n\\nFor more on WHO’s work on antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, visit the Mekong Malaria Elimination Programme webpage.

Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required.\\n\\nIn 2022, 34 countries reported fewer than 1000 indigenous cases of the disease, up from just 13 countries in 2000. Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria are eligible to apply for the WHO certification of malaria elimination. Since 2015, 12 countries have been certified by the WHO Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives (2015), Sri Lanka (2016), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Paraguay (2018), Uzbekistan (2018), Argentina (2019), Algeria (2019), China (2021), El Salvador (2021), Azerbaijan (2023), Tajikistan (2023) and Belize (2023).\\n\\nCountries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO.\\n\\nSurveillance\\n\\nMalaria surveillance is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of malaria-related data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice. Improved surveillance of malaria cases and deaths helps ministries of health determine which areas or population groups are most affected and enables countries to monitor changing disease patterns.

In pregnant women, it can cause the baby to be born early (prematurity).\\n\\n\\n\\nCorrect and consistent use of condoms during sex is the most effective way to prevent chlamydia.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2020, an estimated 128.5 million new infections with Chlamydia trachomatis occurred worldwide among adults aged 15 to 49 years. The global prevalence among people aged 15–49 years was estimated to be 4.0% for women and 2.5% for men in 2020. Chlamydial infection is more common in young people. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is relatively rare, but there has been a resurgence in some countries, especially among gay men and other men who have sex with men. Another strain of the Chlamydia cause trachoma but transmitted by contact with discharge from the eye and nose, particularly among young children.\\n\\n\\n\\nChlamydia is unlikely to lead to any long-term problems if treated early. However, without treatment, chlamydia can cause serious problems and may facilitate the transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STIs.\\n\\n\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nMany people with chlamydia have no symptoms or only mild symptoms.

Hepatitis D infection cannot occur in the absence of hepatitis B virus. HDV-HBV co-infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death.\\n\\nVaccination against hepatitis B is the only method to prevent HDV infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeographical distribution\\n\\nIn a study published in the Journal of Hepatology in 2020 (1), conducted in collaboration with WHO, it was estimated that hepatitis D virus (HDV) affects nearly 5% of people globally who have a chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and that HDV co-infection could explain about 1 in 5 cases of liver disease and liver cancer in people with HBV infection. The study has identified several geographical hotspots of high prevalence of HDV infection including Mongolia, the Republic of Moldova, and countries in western and central Africa.\\n\\n\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nThe routes of HDV transmission, like HBV, occur through broken skin (via injection, tattooing etc.) or through contact with infected blood or blood products. Transmission from mother to child is possible but rare. Vaccination against HBV prevents HDV coinfection and hence expansion of childhood HBV immunization programmes has resulted in a decline in hepatitis D incidence worldwide.\\n\\nChronic HBV carriers are at risk of infection with HDV. People who are not immune to HBV (either by natural disease or immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine) are at risk of infection with HBV, which puts them at risk of HDV infection.', 'Chronic HBV carriers are at risk of infection with HDV. People who are not immune to HBV (either by natural disease or immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine) are at risk of infection with HBV, which puts them at risk of HDV infection.\\n\\nThose who are more likely to have HBV and HDV co-infection include indigenous people, people who inject drugs and people with hepatitis C virus or HIV infection. The risk of co-infection also appears to be potentially higher in recipients of haemodialysis, men who have sex with men and commercial sex workers.\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nIn acute hepatitis, simultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to a mild-to-severe hepatitis with signs and symptoms of indistinguishable from those of other types of acute viral hepatitis infections. These features typically appear 3–7 weeks after initial infection and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale-coloured stools, jaundice (yellow eyes) and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete, development of fulminant hepatitis is infrequent, and chronic hepatitis D is rare (less than 5% of acute hepatitis).\\n\\nIn a superinfection, HDV can infect a person already chronically infected with HBV. The superinfection of HDV on chronic hepatitis B accelerates progression to a more severe disease in all ages and in 70‒90% of persons. HDV superinfection accelerates progression to cirrhosis almost a decade earlier than HBV mono-infected persons. Patients with HDV induced cirrhosis are at an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the mechanism in which HDV causes more severe hepatitis and a faster progression of fibrosis than HBV alone remains unclear.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nHDV infection is diagnosed by high levels of anti-HDV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), and confirmed by detection of HDV RNA in serum.', 'Diagnosis\\n\\nHDV infection is diagnosed by high levels of anti-HDV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), and confirmed by detection of HDV RNA in serum.\\n\\nHowever, HDV diagnostics are not widely available and there is no standardization for HDV RNA assays, which are used for monitoring response to antiviral therapy.\\n\\n\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nPegylated interferon alpha is the generally recommended treatment for hepatitis D virus infection. Treatment should last for at least 48 weeks irrespective of the patient’s response. The virus tends to give a low rate of response to the treatment; however, the treatment is associated with a lower likelihood of disease progression.\\n\\nThis treatment is associated with significant side effects and should not be given to patients with decompensated cirrhosis, active psychiatric conditions and autoimmune diseases. Bulevirtide is one of the new promising treatments for hepatitis D.\\n\\nMore efforts are needed to reduce the global burden of chronic hepatitis B and develop medicines that are safe and effective against hepatitis D and are affordable enough to be deployed on a large scale to those who are most in need.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile WHO does not have specific recommendations on hepatitis D, prevention of HBV transmission through hepatitis B immunization, including a timely birth dose, additional antiviral prophylaxis for eligible pregnant women, blood safety, safe injection practices in health care settings and harm reduction services with clean needles and syringes are effective in preventing HDV transmission. Hepatitis B immunization does not provide protection against HDV for those already infected with HBV.\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO response', 'WHO response\\n\\nGlobal health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030 (GHSSs) guide the health sector in implementing strategically focused responses to achieve the goals of ending AIDS, viral hepatitis (especially chronic hepatitis B and C) and sexually transmitted infections by 2030.\\n\\nThe GHSS recommend shared and disease-specific country actions supported by actions by WHO and partners.

The virus has at least 4 different types: genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans. Genotypes 3 and 4 circulate in several animals including pigs, wild boars and deer without causing any disease, and occasionally infect humans.\\n\\nThe virus is shed in the stools of infected persons and enters the human body through the intestine. It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2–6 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, which can be fatal.\\n\\n\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nHepatitis E infection is found worldwide and is common in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene and health services. In these areas, the disease occurs both as outbreaks and as sporadic cases. The outbreaks usually follow periods of faecal contamination of drinking water supplies and may affect several hundred to several thousand persons. Some of these outbreaks have occurred in areas of conflict and humanitarian emergencies such as war zones and camps for refugees or internally displaced populations, where sanitation and safe water supply pose special challenges.\\n\\nSporadic cases are also believed to be related to contamination of water, albeit at a smaller scale. The cases in these areas are caused mostly by infection with genotype 1 virus, and much less frequently by genotype 2 virus.', 'Sporadic cases are also believed to be related to contamination of water, albeit at a smaller scale. The cases in these areas are caused mostly by infection with genotype 1 virus, and much less frequently by genotype 2 virus.\\n\\nIn areas with better sanitation and water supply, hepatitis E infection is infrequent, with only occasional sporadic cases. Most of these cases are caused by genotype 3 virus and are triggered by infection with virus originating in animals, usually through ingestion of undercooked animal meat (including animal liver, particularly pork). These cases are not related to contamination of water or other foods.\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe incubation period following exposure to HEV ranges from 2 to 10 weeks, with an average of 5 to 6 weeks. The infected persons excrete the virus beginning from a few days before to 3-4 weeks after onset of the disease.\\n\\nIn areas with high disease endemicity, symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 15–40 years. In these areas, although infection does occur in children, it often goes undiagnosed because they typically have no symptoms or only a mild illness without jaundice.\\n\\nTypical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include:\\n\\nan initial phase of mild fever, reduced appetite (anorexia), nausea and vomiting lasting for a few days;\\n\\nabdominal pain, itching , skin rash, or joint pain;\\n\\njaundice (yellow colour of the skin), dark urine and pale stools; and\\n\\na slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly).\\n\\nThese symptoms are often indistinguishable from those experienced during other liver illnesses and typically last 1–6 weeks.\\n\\nIn rare cases, acute hepatitis E can be severe and result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). These patients are at risk of death. Pregnant women with hepatitis E, particularly those in the second or third trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and mortality. Up to 20–25% of pregnant women can die if they get hepatitis E in third trimester.', 'In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can be severe and result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure).

These remain uncommon.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nCases of hepatitis E are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral hepatitis. However, diagnosis can often be strongly suspected in appropriate epidemiologic settings, for example when several cases occur in localities in known disease-endemic areas, in settings with risk of water contamination when the disease is more severe in pregnant women or if hepatitis A has been excluded.\\n\\nDefinitive diagnosis of hepatitis E infection is usually based on the detection of specific anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the virus in a person’s blood; this is usually adequate in areas where the disease is common. Rapid tests are available for field use.\\n\\nAdditional tests include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the hepatitis E virus RNA in blood and stool. This assay requires specialized laboratory facilities. This test is particularly needed in areas where hepatitis E is infrequent and in uncommon cases with chronic HEV infection.\\n\\n\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThere is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute hepatitis E.

These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors and three categories of external agents, including:\\n\\nphysical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation;\\n\\nchemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, alcohol, aflatoxin (a food contaminant), and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant); and\\n\\nbiological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites.\\n\\nWHO, through its cancer research agency, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), maintains a classification of cancer-causing agents.\\n\\nThe incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age.

Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nCancer risk can be reduced by:\\n\\nnot using tobacco;\\n\\nmaintaining a healthy body weight;\\n\\neating a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables;\\n\\ndoing physical activity on a regular basis;\\n\\navoiding or reducing consumption of alcohol;\\n\\ngetting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B if you belong to a group for which vaccination is recommended;\\n\\navoiding ultraviolet radiation exposure (which primarily results from exposure to the sun and artificial tanning devices) and/or using sun protection measures;', 'not using tobacco;\\n\\nmaintaining a healthy body weight;\\n\\neating a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables;\\n\\ndoing physical activity on a regular basis;\\n\\navoiding or reducing consumption of alcohol;\\n\\ngetting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B if you belong to a group for which vaccination is recommended;\\n\\navoiding ultraviolet radiation exposure (which primarily results from exposure to the sun and artificial tanning devices) and/or using sun protection measures;\\n\\nensuring safe and appropriate use of radiation in health care (for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes);\\n\\nminimizing occupational exposure to ionizing radiation; and\\n\\nreducing exposure to outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution, including radon (a radioactive gas produced from the natural decay of uranium, which can accumulate in buildings — homes, schools and workplaces).\\n\\nEarly detection\\n\\nCancer mortality is reduced when cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection: early diagnosis and screening.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly diagnosis\\n\\nWhen identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to treatment and can result in a greater probability of survival with less morbidity, as well as less expensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care.\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly diagnosis consists of three components:\\n\\nbeing aware of the symptoms of different forms of cancer and of the importance of seeking medical advice when abnormal findings are observed;\\n\\naccess to clinical evaluation and diagnostic services; and\\n\\ntimely referral to treatment services.\\n\\nEarly diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care.\\n\\nScreening', 'being aware of the symptoms of different forms of cancer and of the importance of seeking medical advice when abnormal findings are observed;\\n\\naccess to clinical evaluation and diagnostic services; and\\n\\ntimely referral to treatment services.\\n\\nEarly diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers. Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care.\\n\\nScreening\\n\\nScreening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms. When abnormalities are identified during screening, further tests to establish a definitive diagnosis should follow, as should referral for treatment if cancer is proven to be present.\\n\\nScreening programmes are effective for some but not all cancer types and in general are far more complex and resource-intensive than early diagnosis as they require special equipment and dedicated personnel. Even when screening programmes are established, early diagnosis programmes are still necessary to identify those cancer cases occurring in people who do not meet the age or risk factor criteria for screening.\\n\\nPatient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies. Examples of screening methods are:\\n\\nHPV test (including HPV DNA and mRNA test), as preferred modality for cervical cancer screening; and\\n\\nmammography screening for breast cancer for women aged 50–69 residing in settings with strong or relatively strong health systems.\\n\\nQuality assurance is required for both screening and early diagnosis programmes.\\n\\nTreatment', \"Patient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies.

Treatment usually includes surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal treatments, targeted biological therapies). Proper selection of a treatment regimen takes into consideration both the cancer and the individual being treated. Completion of the treatment protocol in a defined period of time is important to achieve the predicted therapeutic result.\\n\\nDetermining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal. This can be achieved by support for the patient’s physical, psychosocial and spiritual well-being and palliative care in terminal stages of cancer.\\n\\nSome of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body.\", 'Some of the most common cancer types, such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, and colorectal cancer, have high cure probabilities when detected early and treated according to best practices.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome cancer types, such as testicular seminoma and different types of leukaemia and lymphoma in children, also have high cure rates if appropriate treatment is provided, even when cancerous cells are present in other areas of the body.\\n\\nThere is, however, a significant variation in treatment availability between countries of different income levels; comprehensive treatment is reportedly available in more than 90% of high-income countries but less than 15% of low-income countries (3).\\n\\nPalliative care\\n\\nPalliative care is treatment to relieve, rather than cure, symptoms and suffering caused by cancer and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families.

In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).\\n\\nBetween 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%.\\n\\nBy contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticed.\\n\\nSymptoms of diabetes include:\\n\\nfeeling very thirsty\\n\\nneeding to urinate more often than usual\\n\\nblurred vision\\n\\nfeeling tired\\n\\nlosing weight unintentionally\\n\\nOver time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves.\\n\\nPeople with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.\\n\\nDiabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes.\\n\\nMany people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow.

This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.\\n\\nType 1 diabetes\\n\\nType 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries. Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes\\n\\nType 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.\\n\\nOver time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes is often preventable. Factors that contribute to developing type 2 diabetes include being overweight, not getting enough exercise, and genetics.\\n\\nEarly diagnosis is important to prevent the worst effects of type 2 diabetes. The best way to detect diabetes early is to get regular check-ups and blood tests with a healthcare provider.\\n\\nSymptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild. They may take several years to be noticed.

Type 2 diabetes was formerly called non-insulin dependent, or adult onset. Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly frequently in children.\\n\\nGestational diabetes\\n\\nGestational diabetes is hyperglycaemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes.

It results from the interaction between health conditions such as dementia, blindness or spinal cord injury, and a range of environmental and personal factors. An estimated 1.3 billion people – or 16% of the global population – experience a significant disability today. This number is growing because of an increase in noncommunicable diseases and people living longer. Persons with disabilities are a diverse group, and factors such as sex, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, race, ethnicity and their economic situation affect their experiences in life and their health needs. Persons with disabilities die earlier, have poorer health, and experience more limitations in everyday functioning than others.\\n\\nFactors contributing to health inequities\\n\\nHealth inequities arise from unfair conditions faced by persons with disabilities.\\n\\nStructural factors: Persons with disabilities experience ableism, stigma and discrimination in all facets of life, which affects their physical and mental health. Laws and policies may deny them the right to make their own decisions and allow a range of harmful practices in the health sector, such as forced sterilization, involuntary admission and treatment, and even institutionalization.\\n\\nSocial determinants of health: Poverty, exclusion from education and employment, and poor living conditions all add to the risk of poor health and unmet health care needs among persons with disabilities. Gaps in formal social support mechanisms mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on support from family members to engage in health and community activities, which not only disadvantages them but also their caregivers (who are mostly women and girls).', 'Social determinants of health: Poverty, exclusion from education and employment, and poor living conditions all add to the risk of poor health and unmet health care needs among persons with disabilities. Gaps in formal social support mechanisms mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on support from family members to engage in health and community activities, which not only disadvantages them but also their caregivers (who are mostly women and girls).\\n\\nRisk factors: Persons with disabilities are more likely to have risk factors for non-communicable diseases, such as smoking, poor diet, alcohol consumption and a lack of physical activity. A key reason for this is that they are often left out of public health interventions.\\n\\nHealth system: Persons with disabilities face barriers in all aspects of the health system. For example, a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes and discriminatory practices among healthcare workers; inaccessible health facilities and information; and lack of information or data collection and analysis on disability, all contribute to health inequities faced by this group.\\n\\nInternational frameworks\\n\\nCountries have an obligation under international human rights law, and in some cases domestic laws, to address the health inequities faced by persons with disabilities. There are two important international frameworks which relate to health equity for persons with disabilities.\\n\\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires States Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the same range, quality and standard of free or affordable health care as other people.', 'The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires States Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the same range, quality and standard of free or affordable health care as other people.\\n\\nThe World Health Assembly Resolution WHA74.8 on the highest attainable standard of health for persons with disabilities calls for Member States to ensure that persons with disabilities receive effective health services as part of universal health coverage; equal protection during emergencies; and equal access to cross-sectoral public health interventions.\\n\\nAchieving health for all\\n\\nDisability inclusion is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and global health priorities to achieve health for all.\\n\\nUniversal health coverage will not be achieved if persons with disabilities do not receive quality health services on an equal basis with others. Investing in universal health coverage for persons with disabilities will benefit not only individuals but also communities.\\n\\nThere could be almost an US$ 10 return for every US$ 1 spent on implementing disability inclusive prevention and care for noncommunicable diseases.\\n\\nPersons with disabilities must be considered when preventing and responding to health emergencies because they are more likely to be affected, both directly and indirectly. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, persons with disabilities living in institutions have been “cut off from the rest of society” with reports of residents being overmedicated, sedated, or locked up, and examples of self-harm also occurring (1).\\n\\nIn the COVID-19 pandemic, there are higher mortality rates among persons with intellectual disabilities (2), who are also less likely to receive intensive care services (3).', 'In the COVID-19 pandemic, there are higher mortality rates among persons with intellectual disabilities (2), who are also less likely to receive intensive care services (3).\\n\\nPromoting healthier populations through clean air and water, road safety, child nutrition and addressing violence against women will only be achieved if public health interventions for the wider population consider the needs, skills and capacities of persons with disabilities.\\n\\nWomen with disabilities being 2–4 times more likely to experience intimate partner violence than those without disabilities (4).\\n\\nThe WHO Global report on health equity for persons with disabilities outlines 40 key actions for countries to take to strengthen their health systems and reduce health inequities for persons with disabilities. There are three things that all governments and health sector partners can do. First, they must consider health equity for persons with disabilities in all health sector actions. Second, they can include persons with disabilities in decision-making processes. Third, they can monitor how persons with disabilities are being reached and benefitting from health sector actions.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nWHO works to ensure persons with disabilities have equitable access to effective health services; are included in health emergencies preparedness and responses; and can access cross-sectoral public health interventions to achieve the highest attainable standard of health. Towards this goal, WHO:\\n\\nguides and supports Member States on disability inclusion in health system governance and planning;\\n\\nfacilitates collection and dissemination of disability-related data and information;\\n\\ndevelops normative tools, including guidelines to strengthen disability inclusion in the health sector;\\n\\nbuilds capacity among health policymakers and service providers;', 'guides and supports Member States on disability inclusion in health system governance and planning;\\n\\nfacilitates collection and dissemination of disability-related data and information;\\n\\ndevelops normative tools, including guidelines to strengthen disability inclusion in the health sector;\\n\\nbuilds capacity among health policymakers and service providers;\\n\\npromotes strategies to ensure that people with disability are knowledgeable about their own health conditions, and that health care personnel support and protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities;\\n\\ncontributes to the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) to promote “sustainable and transformative progress on disability inclusion through all pillars of work of the United Nations”; and\\n\\nprovides Member States and development partners with updated evidence, analysis and recommendations related to disability inclusion in the health sector.\\n\\nReferences', 'Title:Blindness and vision impairment\\n\\nArticle:\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nVision, the most dominant of our senses, plays a critical role in every facet and stage of our lives. We take vision for granted, but without vision, we struggle to learn, to walk, to read, to participate in school and to work.\\n\\nVision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual system and its vision functions. Everyone, if they live long enough, will experience at least one eye condition in their lifetime that will require appropriate care.\\n\\nVision impairment has serious consequences for the individual across the life course. Many of these consequences can be mitigated by timely access to quality eye care. Eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness – such as cataract or refractive error – are, for good reasons, the main focus of eye care strategies; nevertheless, the importance of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment – such as dry eye or conjunctivitis – must not be overlooked. These conditions are frequently among the leading reasons for presentation to eye care services.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nGlobally, the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness are:\\n\\nrefractive errors\\n\\ncataract\\n\\ndiabetic retinopathy\\n\\nglaucoma\\n\\nage-related macular degeneration.\\n\\nThere is substantial variation in the causes of vision impairment between and within countries according to the availability of eye care services, their affordability, and the education of the population. For example, the proportion of vision impairment attributable to unoperated cataract is higher in low- and middle-income countries. In high income countries, diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are more common.\\n\\nAmong children, congenital cataract is a leading cause of vision impairment in low-income countries, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity.', 'Among children, congenital cataract is a leading cause of vision impairment in low-income countries, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity.\\n\\nUncorrected refractive error remains a leading cause of vision impairment in all countries amongst children and adult populations.\\n\\nPrevalence\\n\\nGlobally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment. In at least 1 billion – or almost half – of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.\\n\\nAmong this 1 billion people, the main conditions causing distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract (94 million), refractive error (88.4 million), age-related macular degeneration (8 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million) (1). The main condition causing near vision impairment is presbyopia (826 million) (2).\\n\\nIn terms of regional differences, the prevalence of distance vision impairment in low- and middle-income regions is estimated to be 4 times higher than in high-income regions (1). With regards to near vision, rates of unaddressed near vision impairment are estimated to be greater than 80% in western, eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, while comparative rates in high-income regions of North America, Australasia, western Europe, and of Asia-Pacific are reported to be lower than 10% (2).\\n\\nPopulation growth and ageing are expected to increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment.\\n\\nImpact of vision impairment\\n\\nPersonal impact\\n\\nYoung children with early onset irreversible severe vision impairment can experience delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development, with lifelong consequences. School-age children with vision impairment can also experience lower levels of educational achievement.', 'Population growth and ageing are expected to increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment.\\n\\nImpact of vision impairment\\n\\nPersonal impact\\n\\nYoung children with early onset irreversible severe vision impairment can experience delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development, with lifelong consequences.

Adults with vision impairment can experience lower rates of employment and higher rates of depression and anxiety.\\n\\nIn the case of older adults, vision impairment can contribute to social isolation, difficulty walking, a higher risk of falls and fractures, and a greater likelihood of early entry into nursing or care homes.\\n\\nEconomic impact\\n\\nVision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden with an estimate annual global productivity loss of about US$ 411 billion purchasing power parity (3). This figure far outweighs the estimated cost gap of addressing the unmet need of vision impairment (estimated at about US$ 25 billion).\\n\\nStrategies to address eye conditions to avoid vision impairment', 'Economic impact\\n\\nVision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden with an estimate annual global productivity loss of about US$ 411 billion purchasing power parity (3). This figure far outweighs the estimated cost gap of addressing the unmet need of vision impairment (estimated at about US$ 25 billion).\\n\\nStrategies to address eye conditions to avoid vision impairment\\n\\nThere are effective interventions covering promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation which address the needs associated with eye conditions and vision impairment. While many vision loss cases can be prevented (such as those due to infections, trauma, unsafe traditional medicines, perinatal diseases, nutrition-related diseases, unsafe use or self-administration of topical treatment), this is not possible for all. For many eye conditions, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, early detection and timely treatment are crucial to avoid irreversible vision loss. Spectacle correction for refractive error and surgery for cataract are among the most cost-effective of all health-care interventions. Yet, globally only 36% of people with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error have received access to an appropriate pair of spectacles and only 17% of people with vision impairment or blindness due to cataract have received access to quality surgery.\\n\\nTreatment is also available for many eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, but generate discomfort and pain. Treatment of these conditions is directed at alleviating the symptoms and preventing the evolution towards more severe stages of those diseases.\\n\\nVision rehabilitation is very effective in improving functioning for people with an irreversible vision loss that can be caused by eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, consequences of trauma, and age-related macular degeneration.\\n\\nWHO response', 'Vision rehabilitation is very effective in improving functioning for people with an irreversible vision loss that can be caused by eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, consequences of trauma, and age-related macular degeneration.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nWHO’s work is guided by the recommendations of the WHO World report on vision (2019) and the resolution on \"integrated, people-centred eye care, including preventable blindness and vision impairment\" adopted at the Seventy-third World Health Assembly in 2020. The key proposal is to make integrated people-centred eye care (IPEC) the care model of choice and to ensure its widespread implementation. It is expected that by shaping the global agenda on vision and eye care, the report and resolution will assist Member States and their partners in their efforts to reduce the burden of eye conditions and vision.\\n\\nSome of WHO’s key areas of work and activities in the prevention of blindness include:\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

People with symptoms of asthma should speak to a health professional.\\n\\nImpact\\n\\nAsthma is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\\n\\nPeople with under-treated asthma can suffer sleep disturbance, tiredness during the day, and poor concentration. Asthma sufferers and their families may miss school and work, with financial impact on the family and wider community. If symptoms are severe, people with asthma may need to receive emergency health care and they may be admitted to hospital for treatment and monitoring. In the most severe cases, asthma can lead to death.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of asthma can vary from person to person. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse.

These include low birth weight, prematurity, exposure to tobacco smoke and other sources of air pollution, as well as viral respiratory infections.\\n\\nExposure to a range of environmental allergens and irritants are also thought to increase the risk of asthma, including indoor and outdoor air pollution, house dust mites, moulds, and occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes or dust.\\n\\nChildren and adults who are overweight or obese are at a greater risk of asthma.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nAsthma cannot be cured but there are several treatments available. The most common treatment is to use an inhaler, which delivers medication directly to the lungs.\\n\\nInhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life.\\n\\nThere are two main types of inhaler:\\n\\nbronchodilators (such as salbutamol), that open the air passages and relieve symptoms; and\\n\\nsteroids (such as beclometasone) that reduce inflammation in the air passages, which improves asthma symptoms and reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks and death.', 'Inhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life.\\n\\nThere are two main types of inhaler:\\n\\nbronchodilators (such as salbutamol), that open the air passages and relieve symptoms; and\\n\\nsteroids (such as beclometasone) that reduce inflammation in the air passages, which improves asthma symptoms and reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks and death.\\n\\nPeople with asthma may need to use their inhaler every day. Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available.\\n\\nUsing an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers.\\n\\nAccess to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.\\n\\nIt is also important to raise community awareness to reduce the myths and stigma associated with asthma in some settings.\\n\\nSelf-care\\n\\nPeople with asthma and their families need education to understand more about their asthma.

Adolescents and young adults are at particular risk of meningococcal disease while the elderly are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease.\\n\\nPeople all over the world are at risk of meningitis. The highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African Meningitis Belt, especially recognised to be at high risk of epidemics of meningococcal but also pneumococcal meningitis.\\n\\nHigher risk is seen when people are living in close proximity, for example at mass gatherings, in refugee camps, in overcrowded households or in student, military and other occupational settings. Immune deficiencies such as HIV infection or complement deficiency, immunosuppression, and active or passive smoking can also raise the risk of different types of meningitis.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nThe route of transmission varies by organism. Most bacteria that cause meningitis such as meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae are carried in the human nose and throat. They spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or throat secretions. Group B streptococcus is often carried in the human gut or vagina and can spread from mother to child around the time of birth.\\n\\nCarriage of these organisms is usually harmless and helps build up immunity against infection, but the bacteria occasionally invade the body causing meningitis and sepsis.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nClinical features of patients with meningitis vary depending on the cause, disease course (acute, subacute or chronic), brain involvement (meningo-encephalitis) and systemic complications (e.g., sepsis).\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon symptoms of meningitis are neck stiffness, fever, confusion or altered mental status, headaches, nausea and vomiting.', 'Signs and symptoms\\n\\nClinical features of patients with meningitis vary depending on the cause, disease course (acute, subacute or chronic), brain involvement (meningo-encephalitis) and systemic complications (e.g., sepsis).\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon symptoms of meningitis are neck stiffness, fever, confusion or altered mental status, headaches, nausea and vomiting.\\n\\n\\n\\nLess frequent symptoms are seizures, coma and neurological deficits (for example hearing or vision loss, cognitive impairment, or weakness of the limbs).\\n\\nTypes of meningitis caused by viruses or bacteria can have similar symptoms.

These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. No universal vaccine exists.\\n\\nIn the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80–85% of meningitis epidemics before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass preventive campaigns (since 2010) and into routine immunization programmes (since 2016). Continuing introduction into routine immunization programmes and maintaining high coverage is critical to avoid the resurgence of epidemics.\\n\\n2. Antibiotics for prevention (chemoprophylaxis)\\n\\nAntibiotics for close contacts of those with meningococcal disease, when given promptly, decreases the risk of transmission. Outside the African meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts within the household. Within the meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis for close contacts is recommended in non-epidemic situations. Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice, and ceftriaxone an alternative.\\n\\nIdentifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal disease is recommended in many countries.

The bacteria can sometimes be seen in microscopic examinations of the spinal fluid. The diagnosis is supported or confirmed by growing the bacteria from specimens of cerebrospinal fluid or blood, by rapid diagnostic tests or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The identification of the serogroups and susceptibility to antibiotics are important to define control measures. Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing identify more differences between strains and inform public health responses.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nMeningitis is a medical emergency.\\n\\nMeningitis is potentially fatal within 24 hours and requires urgent medical attention.

Meningitis can vary in severity, appropriate treatment and care depending on the cause. Meningitis caused by bacteria requires immediate antibiotic treatment.\\n\\nAny person who shows signs or symptoms or meningitis should seek immediate care at a hospital or health centre. This will verify if a person has meningitis, confirm the cause of infection and determine the right treatment and care.\\n\\nMeningitis sequelae can have an enormous impact on individuals, families and communities, both financially and emotionally.

Sometimes, complications such as deafness, learning impairment or behavioural problems are not recognized by carers and healthcare workers and therefore go untreated.\\n\\nThose who have lived through meningitis often have health-care needs requiring long-term medical treatments. The ongoing psychosocial impacts of disability from meningitis can have medical, educational, social and human rights-based implications. Despite the high burden of meningitis sequelae on people with meningitis, their families and the community, access to both services and support for these conditions is often insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Individuals and families with members disabled by meningitis should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national Organizations of Disabled People (ODPs) and other disability focused organizations, which can provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure people disabled by meningitis are able to live full and rewarding lives.\\n\\nSurveillance\\n\\nSurveillance, from case detection to investigation and laboratory confirmation is essential to the control of meningitis.

They are more likely in children who are malnourished, especially those without enough vitamin A or with a weak immune system from HIV or other diseases. Measles itself also weakens the immune system and can make the body “forget” how to protect itself against infections, leaving children extremely vulnerable.\\n\\nWho is at risk?\\n\\nAny non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe measles complications.\\n\\nMeasles is still common, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The overwhelming majority of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes or weak health infrastructures that struggle to reach all children with immunization.\\n\\nDamaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection.

The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. For this reason, it is very infectious, and one person infected by measles can infect nine out of 10 of their unvaccinated close contacts. It can be transmitted by an infected person from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts.\\n\\nMeasles outbreaks can result in severe complications and deaths, especially among young, malnourished children. In countries close to measles elimination, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThere is no specific treatment for measles. Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications.\\n\\nDrinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important.\\n\\nDoctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections.\\n\\nAll children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart.

The two genetic clades of the virus are clades I and II.\\n\\nThe monkeypox virus was discovered in Denmark (1958) in monkeys kept for research and the first reported human case of mpox was a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, 1970). Mpox can spread from person to person or occasionally from animals to people. Following eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide, mpox steadily emerged in central, east and west Africa. A global outbreak occurred in 2022–2023. The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown – various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are susceptible.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nPerson-to-person transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or other lesions such as in the mouth or on genitals; this includes contact which is\\n\\nface-to-face (talking or breathing)\\n\\nskin-to-skin (touching or vaginal/anal sex)\\n\\nmouth-to-mouth (kissing)\\n\\nmouth-to-skin contact (oral sex or kissing the skin)', 'Transmission\\n\\nPerson-to-person transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or other lesions such as in the mouth or on genitals; this includes contact which is\\n\\nface-to-face (talking or breathing)\\n\\nskin-to-skin (touching or vaginal/anal sex)\\n\\nmouth-to-mouth (kissing)\\n\\nmouth-to-skin contact (oral sex or kissing the skin)\\n\\nrespiratory droplets or short-range aerosols from prolonged close contact\\n\\nThe virus then enters the body through broken skin, mucosal surfaces (e g oral, pharyngeal, ocular, genital, anorectal), or via the respiratory tract. Mpox can spread to other members of the household and to sex partners. People with multiple sexual partners are at higher risk.\\n\\nAnimal to human transmission of mpox occurs from infected animals to humans from bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping, cooking, playing with carcasses, or eating animals. The extent of viral circulation in animal populations is not entirely known and further studies are underway.\\n\\nPeople can contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linens, through sharps injuries in health care, or in community setting such as tattoo parlours.\\n\\n\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nMpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 1–21 days after exposure.

The mpox rash begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and evolves over 2-4 weeks in stages – macules, papules, vesicles, pustules. Lesions dip in the centre before crusting over. Scabs then fall off. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is a classic feature of mpox. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms.\\n\\nIn the context of the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022 (caused mostly by Clade IIb virus), the illness begins differently in some people. In just over a half of cases, a rash may appear before or at the same time as other symptoms and does not always progress over the body.

In just over a half of cases, a rash may appear before or at the same time as other symptoms and does not always progress over the body. The first lesion can be in the groin, anus, or in or around the mouth.\\n\\nPeople with mpox can become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia, corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing, vomiting and diarrhoea causing severe dehydration or malnutrition; sepsis (infection of the blood with a widespread inflammatory response in the body), inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis), or death. Persons with immune suppression due to medication or medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death due to mpox. People living with HIV that is not well-controlled or treated more often develop severe disease.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nIdentifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get treatment as early as possible and prevent further spread.', 'Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash – skin, fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. Testing blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses.\\n\\nMore information on laboratory confirmation of mpox can be found here.\\n\\n\\n\\nTreatment and vaccination\\n\\nThe goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash, manage pain and prevent complications. Early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection. The vaccine should be given within 4 days of contact with someone who has mpox (or within up to 14 days if there are no symptoms).\\n\\nIt is recommended for people at high risk to get vaccinated to prevent infection with mpox, especially during an outbreak.

Some include a history of joint injury or overuse, older age and being overweight. It affects women more than men.\\n\\nExercise and healthy eating to build strong muscles and keep a healthy weight can reduce symptoms. Surgery to replace joints is used in severe cases to reduce pain and regain mobility.\\n\\nOnce pain and loss of movement function become chronic, people with osteoarthritis often experience restrictions in participating in meaningful activities, decreased well-being, and psychological distress.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nOsteoarthritis is one of the significant contributors to years lived with disability among the musculoskeletal conditions. As osteoarthritis is more prevalent in older people (about 70% are older than 55), global prevalence is expected to increase with the ageing of populations. The typical onset is in the late 40s to mid-50s, although osteoarthritis may also affect younger people, including athletes and people who sustain joint injury or trauma. About 60% of people living with osteoarthritis are women.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of osteoarthritis include pain, swelling, stiffness and trouble moving the affected joint.\\n\\nAs a consequence of reduced movement, muscles often lose strength and people become less able to perform physical activities.\\n\\nOsteoarthritis can affect any joint but is most common in the knees, hips, spine and small joints in the hands. Muscles and tissue around the joint are often affected.\\n\\nSymptoms can develop slowly or start quickly after an injury or strain. Osteoarthritis is chronic and often progressive, so changes happen gradually over time.', 'As a consequence of reduced movement, muscles often lose strength and people become less able to perform physical activities.\\n\\nOsteoarthritis can affect any joint but is most common in the knees, hips, spine and small joints in the hands. Muscles and tissue around the joint are often affected.\\n\\nSymptoms can develop slowly or start quickly after an injury or strain. Osteoarthritis is chronic and often progressive, so changes happen gradually over time.\\n\\nIn severe cases, it can make the joint unusable and cause long-term pain. Some people feel pain even when resting.\\n\\nBeing less physically active can lead to other conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes.\\n\\nOsteoarthritis can greatly reduce the quality of life. It makes movement painful and difficult, which can stop people from participating in home, work or social activities. This can lead to mental health impacts, trouble sleeping and problems in relationships.\\n\\nCause and risk factors\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral risk factors are known to increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis:\\n\\n\\n\\ninjury to the joint, e.g. fractures, strains, repeated stress in sport or at work;\\n\\npre-existing joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout;\\n\\nspecific metabolic diseases, such as diabetes;\\n\\nobesity – specifically for hip and knee osteoarthritis – as characterized by metabolic abnormalities, systemic inflammation, and contributing to excessive load on the joints;\\n\\ngenetics;\\n\\nsociodemographic factors (age, female sex).\\n\\nPrevention and control\\n\\nSeveral key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent osteoarthritis and control the disease progression.

People who suspect they may have syphilis should speak to their healthcare provider.\\n\\nThe early stage of syphilis is treated with a benzathine penicillin (BPG) injection. BPG is the first line treatment for syphilis and the only WHO-recommended treatment for pregnant women with syphilis. As second line treatment, doctors may also use doxycycline, ceftriaxone or azithromycin, which are antibiotic medicines.\\n\\nBPG is also used to treat later stages of syphilis, but more doses are required. Doses are usually given once per week for three weeks, including when it is not possible to identify the stage of infection.\\n\\nBPG can prevent syphilis from being passed from a mother to baby. Babies born with syphilis (congenital syphilis), or babies whose mother had untreated syphilis, need to be treated right away to avoid serious health problems.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nIn 2022, WHO estimated that 8 million adults aged 15–49 acquired syphilis globally. Some countries that systematically monitor syphilis are showing an important increase in syphilis cases among men who have sex with men, including congenital syphilis.\\n\\nIn 2022, WHO estimated there were 700 000 congenital syphilis cases globally. These maternal syphilis cases led to an estimated 150 000 early fetal deaths and stillbirths, 70 000 neonatal deaths, 55 000 preterm or low-birth weight births, and 115 000 infants with clinical diagnosis of congenital syphilis.', 'In 2022, WHO estimated there were 700 000 congenital syphilis cases globally.

It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.\\n\\nThe infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.\\n\\nInfants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.\\n\\nMalaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.\\n\\nThere are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.', 'Symptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\\n\\nSymptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.\\n\\n\\n\\nSymptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome types of malaria can cause severe illness and death.

The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).\\n\\nProgress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among Anopheles mosquitoes. As described in the latest World malaria report, other threats to ITNs include insufficient access, loss of nets due to the stresses of day-to-day life outpacing replacement, and changing behaviour of mosquitoes, which appear to be biting early before people go to bed and resting outdoors, thereby evading exposure to insecticides.\\n\\nChemoprophylaxis\\n\\nTravellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period.', 'Preventive chemotherapies\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines.\\n\\nVaccine\\n\\nSince October 2021, WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M.

WHO is very concerned about reports of partial artemisinin resistance in Africa, confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and, most recently, Tanzania. Regular monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance.\\n\\nFor more on WHO’s work on antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, visit the Mekong Malaria Elimination Programme webpage.

Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required.\\n\\nIn 2022, 34 countries reported fewer than 1000 indigenous cases of the disease, up from just 13 countries in 2000. Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria are eligible to apply for the WHO certification of malaria elimination. Since 2015, 12 countries have been certified by the WHO Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives (2015), Sri Lanka (2016), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Paraguay (2018), Uzbekistan (2018), Argentina (2019), Algeria (2019), China (2021), El Salvador (2021), Azerbaijan (2023), Tajikistan (2023) and Belize (2023).\\n\\nCountries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO.\\n\\nSurveillance\\n\\nMalaria surveillance is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of malaria-related data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice.

All children younger than 5 years of age living with HIV are considered to have advanced HIV disease.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nThe symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection.\\n\\nHIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including:\\n\\nfever\\n\\nheadache\\n\\nrash\\n\\nsore throat.\\n\\nThe infection progressively weakens the immune system.

People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water.\\n\\nPeople living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission.\\n\\nRisk factors\\n\\nBehaviours and conditions that put people at greater risk of contracting HIV include:\\n\\nhaving anal or vaginal sex without a condom;\\n\\nhaving another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis;\\n\\nharmful use of alcohol or drugs in the context of sexual behaviour;\\n\\nsharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, or drug solutions when injecting drugs;\\n\\nreceiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, or tissue transplantation; and\\n\\n\\n\\nmedical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; or accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nHIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. This greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and prevention. People can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves. However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health worker or community worker. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm.', 'Most widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called “window period” when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others. People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days.\\n\\nFollowing a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate linkage with treatment and care.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nHIV is a preventable disease.

They should notify their sexual partner(s) to get tested or treated.\\n\\nTreatments can fail due to:\\n\\nnot taking medications as directed\\n\\nreinfection\\n\\nthe bacterium becoming resistant to the drug\\n\\nhaving another untreated infection with similar symptoms.\\n\\nPeople with gonorrhoea should continue treatment until the infection is cured.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nMost cases of gonorrhoea can be prevented with consistent and correct condom use in every sexual encounter.', 'Treatments can fail due to:\\n\\nnot taking medications as directed\\n\\nreinfection\\n\\nthe bacterium becoming resistant to the drug\\n\\nhaving another untreated infection with similar symptoms.\\n\\nPeople with gonorrhoea should continue treatment until the infection is cured.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nMost cases of gonorrhoea can be prevented with consistent and correct condom use in every sexual encounter.\\n\\nPeople with gonorrhoea should notify current and recent sexual partners to help prevent the spread of the disease.\\n\\nAntibiotic eye ointment is recommended for newborns to prevent gonococcal eye infection.\\n\\nThere are no specific vaccines for the prevention of gonorrhoea.However, studies are showing promising results with the use of a meningococcal type B vaccine (4CMenB) that seems to offer cross-protection against gonorrhoea. WHO is monitoring vaccine trials results.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nWHO has recognized gonorrhoea as a significant public health problem and has set ambitious targets to reduce the global burden through prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. The Global Health Sector Strategies on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs 2022–2030 aims to reduce the incidence of N. gonorrhoeae infection by 90% by 2030, compared to 2020 baseline. WHO is working with countries and partners to improve people-centred case management approaches, ensure appropriate treatment recommendations and effective testing and partner services strategies, support the development of new easy to use and affordable diagnostics and treatment, vaccine development and improve surveillance.\\n\\nWHO also works with countries and partners to improve antimicrobial resistance stewardship through the Enhanced Gonorrhoea Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (EGASP), which includes the implementation and use of better surveillance systems to detect antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and to inform locally appropriate treatment.']\n",

      "\n",
      "Globally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608 000 malaria deaths in 85 countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, the Region was home to 94% of malaria cases (233 million) and 95% (580 000) of malaria deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children under 5 accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in the Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\n",

      "To reduce the risk of getting or spreading hepatitis B, practice safe sex by using condoms and reducing the number of sexual partners, avoid sharing needles or any equipment used for injecting drugs, piercing, or tattooing, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after coming into contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces, and get a hepatitis B vaccine if working in a healthcare setting. HIV causes other infections to get worse, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and mpox. HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery. People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. People living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission. Risk factors for HIV include having anal or vaginal sex without a condom, having another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis, harmful use of alcohol or drugs in the context of sexual behaviour, sharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, or drug solutions when injecting drugs, receiving unsafe infections, blood transfusions, or tissue transplantation, and medical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; or accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers. Diagnosis of HIV can be done through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm. Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 57 million deaths between 2000–2022. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 761 000 in 2000 to 136 000 in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic led to setbacks in surveillance and immunization efforts, and the suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.\n",

      "Asthma can be identified through a combination of symptoms, physical examinations, and diagnostic tests. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. A physical examination may reveal signs such as increased respiratory rate or use of accessory muscles during breathing. Diagnostic tests such as spirometry, peak flow meter readings, and chest X-rays can help confirm the diagnosis. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis.\n",

      "Measles can be prevented through vaccination. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is a combination vaccine that protects against these viruses. It is given in two doses, with the first dose typically administered between 12 and 15 months of age, and the second dose between 4 and 6 years of age. Additionally, maintaining good hygiene practices, such as washing hands frequently and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, can help prevent the spread of measles.\n",
