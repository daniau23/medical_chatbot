      "Key facts\n",
      "\n",
      "Globally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608 000 malaria deaths in 85 countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, the Region was home to 94% of malaria cases (233 million) and 95% (580 000) of malaria deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children under 5 accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in the Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk. Severe symptoms include:\n",
      "\n",
      "extreme tiredness and fatigue\n",
      "\n",
      "impaired consciousness\n",
      "\n",
      "multiple convulsions\n",
      "\n",
      "difficulty breathing\n",
      "\n",
      "dark or bloody urine\n",
      "\n",
      "jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin)\n",
      "\n",
      "abnormal bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "People with severe symptoms should get emergency care right away. Getting treatment early for mild malaria can stop the infection from becoming severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria infection during pregnancy can also cause premature delivery or delivery of a baby with low birth weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disease burden\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the latest World malaria report, there were 249 million cases of malaria in 2022 compared to 244 million cases in 2021. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 608 000 in 2022 compared to 610 000 in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2022 the Region was home to about 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 78% of all malaria deaths in the Region.Four African countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (26.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%) and Mozambique (4.2%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:\n",
      "\n",
      "Use mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present\n",
      "\n",
      "Use mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) after dusk\n",
      "\n",
      "Use coils and vaporizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wear protective clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use window screens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vector control\n",
      "\n",
      "Vector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Progress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among Anopheles mosquitoes. As described in the latest World malaria report, other threats to ITNs include insufficient access, loss of nets due to the stresses of day-to-day life outpacing replacement, and changing behaviour of mosquitoes, which appear to be biting early before people go to bed and resting outdoors, thereby evading exposure to insecticides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemoprophylaxis\n",
      "\n",
      "Travellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preventive chemotherapies\n",
      "\n",
      "Preventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaccine\n",
      "\n",
      "Since October 2021, WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M. The availability of two malaria vaccines is expected to make broad-scale deployment across Africa possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Questions and answers on the RTS,S vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease, prevents deaths and contributes to reducing transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based\n",
      "\n",
      "diagnostic testing (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test).\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria is a serious infection and always requires treatment with medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple medicines are used to prevent and treat malaria. Doctors will choose one or more based on:\n",
      "\n",
      "the type of malaria\n",
      "\n",
      "whether a malaria parasite is resistant to a medicine\n",
      "\n",
      "the weight or age of the person infected with malaria\n",
      "\n",
      "whether the person is pregnant.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the most common medicines for malaria:\n",
      "\n",
      "Artemisinin-based combination therapy medicines are the most effective treatment for P. falciparum malaria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chloroquine is recommended for treatment of infection with the P. vivax parasite only in places where it is still sensitive to this medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primaquine should be added to the main treatment to prevent relapses of infection with the P. vivax and P. ovale parasites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most medicines used are in pill form. Some people may need to go to a health centre or hospital for injectable medicines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antimalarial drug resistance\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last decade, partial artemisinin resistance has emerged as a threat to global malaria control efforts in the Greater Mekong subregion. WHO is very concerned about reports of partial artemisinin resistance in Africa, confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and, most recently, Tanzania. Regular monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more on WHO’s work on antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, visit the Mekong Malaria Elimination Programme webpage. WHO has also developed a strategy to address drug resistance in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Elimination\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate activities. Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, 34 countries reported fewer than 1000 indigenous cases of the disease, up from just 13 countries in 2000. Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria are eligible to apply for the WHO certification of malaria elimination. Since 2015, 12 countries have been certified by the WHO Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives (2015), Sri Lanka (2016), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Paraguay (2018), Uzbekistan (2018), Argentina (2019), Algeria (2019), China (2021), El Salvador (2021), Azerbaijan (2023), Tajikistan (2023) and Belize (2023).\n",
      "\n",
      "Countries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surveillance\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaria surveillance is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of malaria-related data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice. Improved surveillance of malaria cases and deaths helps ministries of health determine which areas or population groups are most affected and enables countries to monitor changing disease patterns. Strong malaria surveillance systems also help countries design effective health interventions and evaluate the impact of their malaria control programmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHO response\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, updated in 2021, provides a technical framework for all malaria-endemic countries. It is intended to guide and support regional and country programmes as they work towards malaria control and elimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategy sets ambitious but achievable global targets, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "reducing malaria case incidence by at least 90% by 2030\n",
      "\n",
      "reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030\n",
      "\n",
      "eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries by 2030\n",
      "\n",
      "preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guided by this strategy, the Global Malaria Programme coordinates the WHO’s global efforts to control and eliminate malaria by:\n",
      "\n",
      "playing a leadership role in malaria, effectively supporting member states and rallying partners to reach Universal Health Coverage and achieve goals and targets of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria;\n",
      "\n",
      "shaping the research agenda and promoting the generation of evidence to support global guidance for new tools and strategies to achieve impact;\n",

countries.\\n\\nThe WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden.\\n\\nIn 2022, the Region was home to 94% of malaria cases (233 million) and 95% (580 000) of malaria deaths.\\n\\nChildren under 5 accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in the Region.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nMalaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of

It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.\\n\\nThe infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.\\n\\nSymptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.\\n\\nInfants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.\\n\\nMalaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female\\xa0Anopheles\\xa0mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum\\xa0malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.\\n\\nThere are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species –\\xa0P. falciparum\\xa0and\\xa0P. vivax\\xa0– pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\\n\\nSymptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria', 'title': 'Malaria', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on malaria providing key facts, definition, information on transmission, symptoms, who is at risk, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, insecticide resistance, surveillance, elimination, vaccines and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Symptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\\n\\nSymptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.\\n\\nSymptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important.\\n\\nSome types of malaria can cause severe illness and death.

The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).\\n\\nProgress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among\\xa0Anopheles\\xa0mosquitoes. As described in the latest World malaria report, other threats to ITNs include insufficient access, loss of nets due to the stresses of day-to-day life outpacing replacement, and changing behaviour of mosquitoes, which appear to be biting early before people go to bed and resting outdoors, thereby evading exposure to insecticides.\\n\\nChemoprophylaxis\\n\\nTravellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period.\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria', 'title': 'Malaria', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on malaria providing key facts, definition, information on transmission, symptoms, who is at risk, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, insecticide resistance, surveillance, elimination, vaccines and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Preventive chemotherapies\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy\\xa0is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences.

It also increases the risk of HIV infection.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection that can occur in both men and women. It is caused by a bacterium called\\n\\nChlamydia trachomatis. It is easily treated and cured with antibiotics.\\n\\nIf not treated, chlamydia can cause serious problems, including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. In pregnant women, it can cause the baby to be born early (prematurity).\\n\\nCorrect and consistent use of condoms during sex is the most effective way to prevent chlamydia.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nIn 2020, an estimated 128.5\\xa0million new infections with\\n\\nChlamydia trachomatis occurred worldwide among adults aged 15 to 49 years. The global prevalence among people aged 15–49 years was estimated to be 4.0% for women and 2.5% for men in 2020. Chlamydial infection is more common in young people. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is relatively rare, but there has been a resurgence in some countries, especially among gay men and other men who have sex with men. Another strain of the Chlamydia cause\\n\\ntrachoma but transmitted by contact with discharge from the eye and nose, particularly among young children.\\n\\nChlamydia is unlikely to lead to any long-term problems if treated early. However, without treatment, chlamydia can cause serious problems and may facilitate the transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STIs.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nMany people with chlamydia have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may not appear until up to three weeks after having sex with someone who has chlamydia.\\n\\nIn women, common symptoms include\\n\\na change in vaginal discharge', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chlamydia', 'title': 'Chlamydia', 'description': \"WHO fact sheet on chlamydia, including symptoms, treatments, prevention and WHO's response.\", 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Chlamydia is unlikely to lead to any long-term problems if treated early.

These can be treated with antibiotic medications for newborns.\\n\\nThe LGV type of chlamydia can cause severe inflammation and can lead to genital ulcer, lymph node enlargement, or inflammation of the anorectal area with discharge, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, constipation, fever or pain while passing stools.\\n\\nPossible complications\\n\\nChlamydia can cause serious problems if left untreated, particularly among women. Women may develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), can experience abdominal and pelvic pain, and in later stages develop infertility and ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb).\\n\\nMen may develop a painful infection in their testicles (epididymitis, epididymo-orchitis). In rare cases, this can lead to infertility. Additionally, chlamydia may cause other symptoms, such as swollen joints (arthritis) and inflammation of the eyes.\\n\\nInfection with chlamydia can cause stigma and affect personal relationships. These effects are important but often not quantifiable.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chlamydia', 'title': 'Chlamydia', 'description': \"WHO fact sheet on chlamydia, including symptoms, treatments, prevention and WHO's response.\", 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Men may develop a painful infection in their testicles (epididymitis, epididymo-orchitis).

These effects are important but often not quantifiable.\\n\\nNeonatal infection can cause conjunctivitis (eye infection) and pneumonia. It can also cause preterm deliveries.\\n\\nLGV can be an invasive, systemic infection and, if it is not treated early, can lead to chronic oozing lesions around anorectal region, strictures or reactive joint pain and swelling Oral ulceration can occur and might be associated with lymph node swelling.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nMolecular tests are the gold standard for diagnosing C. trachomatis which can be performed in the lab or at the point of care using molecular tests. Some rapid diagnostic tests are available in the market, but currently they perform poorly compared to molecular tests.\\n\\nSexual history taking and risk assessment are crucial before diagnosis. Clinical examination, speculum examination and palpation can provide important clues to clinical diagnosis.\\n\\nIn many primary health care settings where diagnostic capacity for detecting C. trachomatis is not available, a syndromic approach for case management is recommended.\\n\\nUrine samples are commonly used for diagnosing chlamydia but are less sensitive than swab-collected samples from genital (vaginal or urethral), anal and oropharyngeal sites. The collection of samples from different anatomic sites depends on sexual practices and medical history.

They should notify their sexual partner(s) to get tested and treated, if necessary.\\n\\nWHO guidelines for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nConsistent and correct use of condoms when having vaginal and anal sex is the only way to prevent chlamydial infection.\\n\\nIf you are pregnant, getting tested for chlamydia and receiving prompt treatment if you test positive can prevent transmission to the baby.\\n\\nThere are no vaccines for the prevention of chlamydial infection.\\n\\nWHO response', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chlamydia', 'title': 'Chlamydia', 'description': \"WHO fact sheet on chlamydia, including symptoms, treatments, prevention and WHO's response.\", 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='WHO guidelines for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nConsistent and correct use of condoms when having vaginal and anal sex is the only way to prevent chlamydial infection.\\n\\nIf you are pregnant, getting tested for chlamydia and receiving prompt treatment if you test positive can prevent transmission to the baby.\\n\\nThere are no vaccines for the prevention of chlamydial infection.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nThe WHO has recognized chlamydia as an important public health problem along with other some sexually transmitted infections and has set ambitious targets to reduce the global burden through prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. The Global health sector strategies on HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs 2022–2030 aims for a 50% reduction in new cases of chlamydia by 2030. WHO is working with countries and partners to improve people-centered case management approaches, ensure appropriate treatment recommendations and effective testing and partner services strategies, support the development of high-quality, easy to use and affordable diagnostics and treatment, vaccine development and improved country and global level monitoring of new infections.\\n\\nRelated\\n\\nWHO guidelines for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis\\n\\nChlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis and syphilis: global prevalence and incidence estimates,

1.1\\xa0million deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma\\n        (primary liver cancer).\\n\\nHepatitis B can be prevented by vaccines that are safe, available and effective.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nHepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. The infection can be acute (short and severe) or chronic (long term).\\n\\nHepatitis B can cause a chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis and liver cancer.\\n\\nIt can spread through contact with infected body fluids like blood, saliva, vaginal fluids and semen. It can also be passed from a mother to her baby.\\n\\nHepatitis B can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. The vaccine is usually given soon after birth with boosters a few weeks later. It offers nearly 100% protection against the virus.\\n\\nHepatitis B is a major global health problem. The burden of infection is highest in the WHO Western Pacific Region and the WHO African Region, where 97\\xa0million and 65\\xa0million people, respectively, are chronically infected. Sixty-one\\xa0million people are infected in the WHO South-East Asia Region, 15\\xa0million in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, 11\\xa0million in the WHO in the WHO European Region and 5\\xa0million in the WHO Region of the Americas.\\n\\nTransmission', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b', 'title': 'Hepatitis B', 'description': 'Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Hepatitis B is a major global health problem.

The development of chronic infection is common in infants infected from their mothers or before the age of 5 years.\\n\\nHepatitis B is also spread by needlestick injury, tattooing, piercing and exposure to infected blood and body fluids, such as saliva and menstrual, vaginal and seminal fluids. Transmission of the virus may also occur through the reuse of contaminated needles and syringes or sharp objects either in health care settings, in the community or among persons who inject drugs. Sexual transmission is more prevalent in unvaccinated persons with multiple sexual partners.\\n\\nHepatitis B infection acquired in adulthood leads to chronic hepatitis in less than 5% of cases, whereas infection in infancy and early childhood leads to chronic hepatitis in about 95% of cases. This is the basis for strengthening and prioritizing infant and childhood vaccination.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b', 'title': 'Hepatitis B', 'description': 'Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Hepatitis B infection acquired in adulthood leads to chronic hepatitis in less than 5% of cases, whereas infection in infancy and early childhood leads to chronic hepatitis in about 95% of cases. This is the basis for strengthening and prioritizing infant and childhood vaccination.\\n\\nThe hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. The incubation period of the hepatitis B virus ranges from 30 to 180 days. The virus may be detected within 30 to 60 days after infection and can persist and develop into chronic hepatitis B, especially when transmitted in infancy or childhood.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nMost people do not experience any symptoms when newly infected.\\n\\nSome people have acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks:\\n\\nyellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)\\n\\ndark urine\\n\\nfeeling very tired\\n\\nnausea\\n\\nvomiting\\n\\npain in the abdomen.\\n\\nWhen severe, acute hepatitis can lead to liver failure, which can lead to death.\\n\\nAlthough most people will recover from acute illness, some people with chronic hepatitis B will develop progressive liver disease and complications like cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer). These diseases can be fatal.\\n\\nHBV-HIV coinfection\\n\\nAbout 1% of persons living with HBV infection (2.7\\xa0million people) are also infected with HIV. Conversely, the global prevalence of HBV infection in HIV-infected persons is 7.4%. Since 2015, WHO has recommended treatment for everyone diagnosed with HIV infection, regardless of the stage of disease. Tenofovir, which is included in the treatment combinations recommended as first-line therapy for HIV infection, is also active against HBV.\\n\\nDiagnosis', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b', 'title': 'Hepatitis B', 'description': 'Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='HBV-HIV coinfection\\n\\nAbout 1% of persons living with HBV infection (2.7\\xa0million people) are also infected with HIV.

Tenofovir, which is included in the treatment combinations recommended as first-line therapy for HIV infection, is also active against HBV.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nIt is not possible on clinical grounds to differentiate hepatitis B from hepatitis caused by other viral agents; hence laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is essential. Several blood tests are available to diagnose and monitor people with hepatitis B. Some laboratory tests can be used to distinguish acute and chronic infections, whilst other can assess and monitor the severity of liver disease. Physical examination, ultrasound, fibroscan can also be performed to assess degree of liver fibrosis and scarring and monitor progression of liver disease. WHO recommends that all blood donations be tested for hepatitis B to ensure blood safety and avoid accidental transmission.\\n\\nAs of 2022, 13% of all people estimated to be living with hepatitis B were aware of their infection, while 3% (7 million) of the people living with chronic hepatitis B were on treatment. According to latest WHO estimates, the proportion of children under five years of age chronically infected with HBV dropped to just under 1% in 2019 down from around 5% in the pre-vaccine era ranging from the 1980s to the early 2000s.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b', 'title': 'Hepatitis B', 'description': 'Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='As of 2022, 13% of all people estimated to be living with hepatitis B were aware of their infection, while 3% (7 million) of the people living with chronic hepatitis B were on treatment.

In high-income countries, patients present to hospital earlier in the course of the disease and have access to surgery and chemotherapy, which can prolong life for several months to a few years. Liver transplantation is sometimes used in people with cirrhosis or liver cancer in technologically advanced countries, with varying success.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nHepatitis B is preventable with a vaccine.\\n\\nAll babies should receive the hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth (within 24 hours).

It can cause both acute (short term) and chronic (long term) illness. It can be life-threatening.\\n\\nHepatitis C is spread through contact with infected blood. This can happen through sharing needles or syringes, or from unsafe medical procedures such as blood transfusions with unscreened blood products.\\n\\nSymptoms can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice).\\n\\nThere is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it can be treated with antiviral medications.\\n\\nEarly detection and treatment can prevent serious liver damage and improve long-term health.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c', 'title': 'Hepatitis C', 'description': 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes both acute and chronic infection.

Around 30% (15–45%) of infected persons spontaneously clear the virus within 6 months of infection without any treatment.\\n\\nThe remaining 70% (55–85%) of persons will develop chronic HCV infection. Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis ranges from 15% to 30% within 20 years.\\n\\nGeographical distribution\\n\\nHepatitis C virus infection occurs in all WHO regions. The highest burden of disease is in the Eastern Mediterranean Region with 12\\xa0million people chronically infected. In the South-East Asia Region (9 million), European Region (9 million) and the Western Pacific Region (7 million) people are chronically infected. Eight million people are chronically infected in the African Region and 5 million the Region of the Americas.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nThe hepatitis C virus is a bloodborne virus. It is most commonly transmitted through:\\n\\nthe reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, especially syringes and needles in healthcare settings;\\n\\nthe transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products; and\\n\\ninjecting drug use through the sharing of injection equipment.\\n\\nHCV can be passed from an infected mother to her baby and via sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood (for example, people with multiple sexual partners and among men who have sex with men); however, these modes of transmission are less common.\\n\\nHepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\\n\\nSymptoms', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c', 'title': 'Hepatitis C', 'description': 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes both acute and chronic infection.

In those people who develop chronic HCV infection, the infection is often undiagnosed because it remains asymptomatic until decades after infection when symptoms develop secondary to serious liver damage.\\n\\nHCV infection is diagnosed in 2 steps:\\n\\nTesting for anti-HCV antibodies with a serological test identifies people who have been infected with the virus.\\n\\nIf the test is positive for anti-HCV antibodies, a nucleic acid test for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is needed to confirm chronic infection and the need for treatment. This test is important because about 30% of people infected with HCV spontaneously clear the infection by a strong immune response without the need for treatment. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies. This nucleic acid for HCV RNA can either be done in a lab or using a simple point-of-care machine in the clinic.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c', 'title': 'Hepatitis C', 'description': 'Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes both acute and chronic infection.

Hepatitis D infection cannot occur in the absence of hepatitis B virus. HDV-HBV co-infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death.\\n\\nVaccination against hepatitis B is the only method to prevent HDV infection.\\n\\nGeographical distribution\\n\\nIn a study published in the\\n\\nJournal of Hepatology in 2020\\n\\n(1), conducted in collaboration with WHO, it was estimated that hepatitis D virus (HDV) affects nearly 5% of people globally who have a chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and that HDV co-infection could explain about 1 in 5 cases of liver disease and liver cancer in people with HBV infection. The study has identified several geographical hotspots of high prevalence of HDV infection including Mongolia, the Republic of Moldova, and countries in western and central Africa.\\n\\nTransmission', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-d', 'title': 'Hepatitis D', 'description': 'Hepatitis D is a liver disease in both acute and chronic forms caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV) that requires HBV for its replication. HDV-HBV co-infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards liver-related death and hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Transmission\\n\\nThe routes of HDV transmission, like HBV, occur through broken skin (via injection, tattooing etc.) or through contact with infected blood or blood products. Transmission from mother to child is possible but rare. Vaccination against HBV prevents HDV coinfection and hence expansion of childhood HBV immunization programmes has resulted in a decline in hepatitis D incidence worldwide.\\n\\nChronic HBV carriers are at risk of infection with HDV. People who are not immune to HBV (either by natural disease or immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine) are at risk of infection with HBV, which puts them at risk of HDV infection.\\n\\nThose who are more likely to have HBV and HDV co-infection include indigenous people, people who inject drugs and people with hepatitis C virus or HIV infection. The risk of co-infection also appears to be potentially higher in recipients of haemodialysis, men who have sex with men and commercial sex workers.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nIn acute hepatitis, simultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to a mild-to-severe hepatitis with signs and symptoms of indistinguishable from those of other types of acute viral hepatitis infections. These features typically appear 3–7 weeks after initial infection and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale-coloured stools, jaundice (yellow eyes) and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete, development of fulminant hepatitis is infrequent, and chronic hepatitis D is rare (less than 5% of acute hepatitis).', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-d', 'title': 'Hepatitis D', 'description': 'Hepatitis D is a liver disease in both acute and chronic forms caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV) that requires HBV for its replication.

The superinfection of HDV on chronic hepatitis B accelerates progression to a more severe disease in all ages and in 70‒90% of persons. HDV superinfection accelerates progression to cirrhosis almost a decade earlier than HBV mono-infected persons. Patients with HDV induced cirrhosis are at an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the mechanism in which HDV causes more severe hepatitis and a faster progression of fibrosis than HBV alone remains unclear.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nHDV infection is diagnosed by high levels of anti-HDV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), and confirmed by detection of HDV RNA in serum.\\n\\nHowever, HDV diagnostics are not widely available and there is no standardization for HDV RNA assays, which are used for monitoring response to antiviral therapy.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nPegylated interferon alpha is the generally recommended treatment for hepatitis D virus infection. Treatment should last for at least 48 weeks irrespective of the patient’s response. The virus tends to give a low rate of response to the treatment; however, the treatment is associated with a lower likelihood of disease progression.\\n\\nThis treatment is associated with significant side effects and should not be given to patients with decompensated cirrhosis, active psychiatric conditions and autoimmune diseases.

Hepatitis B immunization does not provide protection against HDV for those already infected with HBV.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nGlobal health sector strategies on, respectively, HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections for the period 2022–2030 (GHSSs) guide the health sector in implementing strategically focused responses to achieve the goals of ending AIDS, viral hepatitis (especially chronic hepatitis B and C)\\xa0 and sexually transmitted infections by 2030.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-d', 'title': 'Hepatitis D', 'description': 'Hepatitis D is a liver disease in both acute and chronic forms caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV) that requires HBV for its replication.

licensed in China, but is not yet available elsewhere.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nHepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). The virus has at least 4 different types: genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4. Genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans. Genotypes 3 and 4 circulate in several animals including pigs, wild boars and deer without causing any disease, and occasionally infect humans.\\n\\nThe virus is shed in the stools of infected persons and enters the human body through the intestine. It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 2–6 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, which can be fatal.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nHepatitis E infection is found worldwide and is common in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to essential water, sanitation, hygiene and health services. In these areas, the disease occurs both as outbreaks and as sporadic cases. The outbreaks usually follow periods of faecal contamination of drinking water supplies and may affect several hundred to several thousand persons. Some of these outbreaks have occurred in areas of conflict and humanitarian emergencies such as war zones and camps for refugees or internally displaced populations, where sanitation and safe water supply pose special challenges.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-e', 'title': 'Hepatitis E', 'description': 'Every year there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E infections, over 3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E, and 56 600 hepatitis E-related deaths.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Sporadic cases are also believed to be related to contamination of water, albeit at a smaller scale. The cases in these areas are caused mostly by infection with genotype 1 virus, and much less frequently by genotype 2 virus.\\n\\nIn areas with better sanitation and water supply, hepatitis E infection is infrequent, with only occasional sporadic cases. Most of these cases are caused by genotype 3 virus and are triggered by infection with virus originating in animals, usually through ingestion of undercooked animal meat (including animal liver, particularly pork). These cases are not related to contamination of water or other foods.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe incubation period following exposure to HEV ranges from 2 to 10 weeks, with an average of 5 to 6 weeks. The infected persons excrete the virus beginning from a few days before to 3-4 weeks after onset of the disease.\\n\\nIn areas with high disease endemicity, symptomatic infection is most common in young adults aged 15–40 years. In these areas, although infection does occur in children, it often goes undiagnosed because they typically have no symptoms or only a mild illness without jaundice.\\n\\nTypical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include:\\n\\nan initial phase of mild fever, reduced appetite (anorexia), nausea and vomiting lasting for a few days;\\n\\nabdominal pain, itching , skin rash, or joint pain;\\n\\njaundice (yellow colour of the skin), dark urine and pale stools; and\\n\\na slightly enlarged, tender liver (hepatomegaly).\\n\\nThese symptoms are often indistinguishable from those experienced during other liver illnesses and typically last 1–6 weeks.\\n\\nIn rare cases, acute hepatitis E can be severe and result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). These patients are at risk of death. Pregnant women with hepatitis E, particularly those in the second or third trimester, are at increased risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and mortality. Up to 20–25% of pregnant women can die if they get hepatitis E in third trimester.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-e', 'title': 'Hepatitis E', 'description': 'Every year there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E infections, over 3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E, and 56 600 hepatitis E-related deaths.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can be severe and result in fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure).

Up to 20–25% of pregnant women can die if they get hepatitis E in third trimester.\\n\\nCases of chronic hepatitis E infection have been reported in immunosuppressed people, particularly organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs, with genotype 3 or 4 HEV infection. These remain uncommon.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nCases of hepatitis E are not clinically distinguishable from other types of acute viral hepatitis. However, diagnosis can often be strongly suspected in appropriate epidemiologic settings, for example when several cases occur in localities in known disease-endemic areas, in settings with risk of water contamination when the disease is more severe in pregnant women or if hepatitis A has been excluded.\\n\\nDefinitive diagnosis of hepatitis E infection is usually based on the detection of specific anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the virus in a person’s blood; this is usually adequate in areas where the disease is common. Rapid tests are available for field use.\\n\\nAdditional tests include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the hepatitis E virus RNA in blood and stool. This assay requires specialized laboratory facilities. This test is particularly needed in areas where hepatitis E is infrequent and in uncommon cases with chronic HEV infection.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThere is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute\\nhepatitis E. As the disease is usually self-limiting, hospitalization is\\ngenerally not required. It is important to avoid unnecessary medications that\\ncan adversely affect liver function, e.g. acetaminophen, paracetamol.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-e', 'title': 'Hepatitis E', 'description': 'Every year there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E infections, over 3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E, and 56 600 hepatitis E-related deaths.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Treatment\\n\\nThere is no specific treatment capable of altering the course of acute\\nhepatitis E.

In some specific situations,\\ninterferon has also been used successfully.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nPrevention is the most effective approach against the infection. At the population level, transmission of HEV and hepatitis E infection can be reduced by:\\n\\nmaintaining quality standards for public water supplies; and\\n\\nestablishing proper disposal systems for human faeces.\\n\\nOn an individual level, infection risk can be reduced by:\\n\\nmaintaining hygienic practices; and\\n\\navoiding consumption of water and ice of unknown purity.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nIn March 2022, Médecins Sans Frontières and South Sudan’s Ministry of Health launched the first hepatitis E vaccination outbreak response campaign at Bentiu internally displaced persons camp in South Sudan’s Unity state. This is the first ever use of the currently only available hepatitis E vaccine, Hecolin, which has been recommended by WHO for outbreak response since 2015.

Document(page_content='An estimated 491 million people aged 15–49 (13%) worldwide have herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection, the main cause of genital herpes.\\n\\nMost HSV infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized, but symptoms of herpes include painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over time.\\n\\nInfection with HSV-2 increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV infection.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV), known as herpes, is a common infection that can cause painful blisters or ulcers. It primarily spreads by skin-to-skin contact. It is treatable but not curable.\\n\\nThere are two types of herpes simplex virus.\\n\\nType 1 (HSV-1) mostly spreads by oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth (oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes. Most adults are infected with HSV-1.\\n\\nType 2 (HSV-2) spreads by sexual contact and causes genital herpes.\\n\\nMost people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over time. Medicines can reduce symptoms but can’t cure the infection.\\n\\nRecurrent symptoms of both oral and genital herpes may be distressing. Genital herpes may also be stigmatizing and have an impact on sexual relationships. However, in time, most people with either kind of herpes adjust to living with the infection.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nMost people with herpes have no symptoms or only mild symptoms.

Most HSV-1 infections are acquired during childhood.\\n\\nGenital herpes caused by HSV-2 affects an estimated 491\\xa0million (13%) people aged 15–49 years worldwide (2016 data). HSV-2 infects women almost twice as often as men because sexual transmission is more efficient from men to women.

HSV-2 infects women almost twice as often as men because sexual transmission is more efficient from men to women. Prevalence increases with age, though the highest number of new infections are in adolescents.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nHSV-1 is mainly transmitted via contact with the virus in sores, saliva or surfaces in or around the mouth. Less commonly, HSV-1 can be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes. It can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal; however, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores. People who already have HSV-1 are not at risk of reinfection, but they are still at risk of acquiring HSV-2.\\n\\nHSV-2 is mainly transmitted during sex through contact with genital or anal surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. HSV-2 can be transmitted even if the skin looks normal and is often transmitted in the absence of symptoms.\\n\\nIn rare circumstances, herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, causing neonatal herpes.\\n\\nPossible complications\\n\\nHSV-2 and HIV infection\\n\\nHSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately three-fold. Additionally, people with both HIV and HSV-2 infection are more likely to spread HIV to others. HSV-2 infection is among the most common infections in people living with HIV.\\n\\nSevere disease\\n\\nIn immunocompromised people, including those with advanced HIV infection, herpes can have more severe symptoms and more frequent recurrences. Rare complications of HSV-2 include meningoencephalitis (brain infection) and disseminated infection. Rarely, HSV-1 infection can lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis (brain infection) or keratitis (eye infection).\\n\\nNeonatal herpes', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus', 'title': 'Herpes simplex virus', 'description': 'Herpes simplex virus fact sheet with key facts and information on type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2): signs and symptoms, transmission, challenges, treatment,  global impact and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Severe disease\\n\\nIn immunocompromised people, including those with advanced HIV infection, herpes can have more severe symptoms and more frequent recurrences.

Rarely, HSV-1 infection can lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis (brain infection) or keratitis (eye infection).\\n\\nNeonatal herpes\\n\\nNeonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV during delivery. Neonatal herpes is rare, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100\\xa0000 births globally. However, it is a serious condition that can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death.\\xa0The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV for the first time in late pregnancy.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nPeople with symptoms of oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others (including oral sex) and sharing objects that touched saliva. Individuals with symptoms of genital herpes should abstain from sexual activity while experiencing symptoms. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are most contagious when sores are present but can also be transmitted when no symptoms are felt or visible.\\n\\nFor sexually active people, consistent and correct use of condoms is the best way to prevent genital herpes and other STIs. Condoms reduce the risk; however, HSV infection can still occur through contact with genital or anal areas not covered by the condom. Medical male circumcision can provide life-long partial protection against HSV-2 infection, as well as against HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).\\n\\nPeople with symptoms suggestive of genital herpes should be offered HIV testing.\\n\\nPregnant women with symptoms of genital herpes should inform their health care providers.

Other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. One defining\\n    feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Widespread metastases\\n    are the primary cause of death from cancer.\\n\\nThe problem\\n\\nCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 (1). The most common in 2020 (in terms of new cases of cancer) were:\\n\\nbreast (2.26 million cases);\\n\\nlung (2.21 million cases);\\n\\ncolon and rectum (1.93 million cases);\\n\\nprostate (1.41 million cases);\\n\\nskin (non-melanoma) (1.20 million cases); and\\n\\nstomach (1.09 million cases).\\n\\nThe most common causes of cancer death in 2020 were:\\n\\nlung (1.80 million deaths);\\n\\ncolon and rectum (916 000 deaths);\\n\\nliver (830 000 deaths);\\n\\nstomach (769 000 deaths); and\\n\\nbreast (685 000 deaths).\\n\\nEach year, approximately 400 000 children develop cancer.

The most common cancers vary between countries. Cervical cancer is the most common in 23 countries.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nCancer arises from the transformation of normal cells into tumour cells in a multi-stage process that generally progresses from a pre-cancerous lesion to a malignant tumour. These changes are the result of the interaction between a person's genetic factors\\n    and three categories of external agents, including:\\n\\nphysical carcinogens, such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation;\\n\\nchemical carcinogens, such as asbestos, components of tobacco smoke, alcohol, aflatoxin (a food contaminant), and arsenic (a drinking water contaminant); and\\n\\nbiological carcinogens, such as infections from certain viruses, bacteria, or parasites.\\n\\nWHO, through its cancer research agency, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), maintains a classification of cancer-causing agents.\\n\\nThe incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age. The overall risk accumulation is combined with the tendency for cellular repair mechanisms to be less effective as\\n    a person grows older.\\n\\nRisk factors\\n\\nTobacco use, alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and air pollution are risk factors for cancer and other noncommunicable diseases.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer', 'title': 'Cancer', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on cancer providing key facts and information on figures, causes, risk factors, prevention, early diagnosis, \\ntreatment, palliative care, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='The incidence of cancer rises dramatically with age, most likely due to a build-up of risks for specific cancers that increase with age.

Approximately 13% of cancers diagnosed in 2018 globally were attributed to carcinogenic infections, including Helicobacter pylori, human\\n    papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (2).\\n\\nHepatitis B and C viruses and some types of HPV increase the risk for liver and cervical cancer, respectively. Infection with HIV increases the risk of developing cervical cancer six-fold and substantially increases the risk of developing select other\\n    cancers such as Kaposi sarcoma.\\n\\nReducing the burden\\n\\nBetween 30 and 50% of cancers can currently be prevented by avoiding risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and appropriate treatment and care\\n    of patients who develop cancer. Many cancers have a high chance of cure if diagnosed early and treated appropriately.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nCancer risk can be reduced by:\\n\\nnot using tobacco;\\n\\nmaintaining a healthy body weight;\\n\\neating a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables;\\n\\ndoing physical activity on a regular basis;\\n\\navoiding or reducing consumption of alcohol;\\n\\ngetting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B if you belong to a group for which vaccination is recommended;\\n\\navoiding ultraviolet radiation exposure (which primarily results from exposure to the sun and artificial tanning devices) and/or using sun protection measures;', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer', 'title': 'Cancer', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on cancer providing key facts and information on figures, causes, risk factors, prevention, early diagnosis, \\ntreatment, palliative care, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='not using tobacco;\\n\\nmaintaining a healthy body weight;\\n\\neating a healthy diet, including fruit and vegetables;\\n\\ndoing physical activity on a regular basis;\\n\\navoiding or reducing consumption of alcohol;\\n\\ngetting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B if you belong to a group for which vaccination is recommended;\\n\\navoiding ultraviolet radiation exposure (which primarily results from exposure to the sun and artificial tanning devices) and/or using sun protection measures;\\n\\nensuring safe and appropriate use of radiation in health care (for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes);\\n\\nminimizing occupational exposure to ionizing radiation; and\\n\\nreducing exposure to outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution, including radon (a radioactive gas produced from the natural decay of uranium, which can accumulate in buildings — homes, schools and workplaces).\\n\\nEarly detection\\n\\nCancer mortality is reduced when cases are detected and treated early. There are two components of early detection: early diagnosis and screening.\\n\\nEarly diagnosis\\n\\nWhen identified early, cancer is more likely to respond to treatment and can result in a greater probability of survival with less morbidity, as well as less expensive treatment. Significant improvements can be made in the lives of cancer patients by\\n    detecting cancer early and avoiding delays in care.\\n\\nEarly diagnosis consists of three components:\\n\\nbeing aware of the symptoms of different forms of cancer and of the importance of seeking medical advice when abnormal findings are observed;\\n\\naccess to clinical evaluation and diagnostic services; and\\n\\ntimely referral to treatment services.\\n\\nEarly diagnosis of symptomatic cancers is relevant in all settings and the majority of cancers.

Cancer programmes should be designed to reduce delays in, and barriers to, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care.\\n\\nScreening\\n\\nScreening aims to identify individuals with findings suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer before they have developed symptoms. When abnormalities are identified during screening, further tests to establish a definitive diagnosis should follow,\\n    as should referral for treatment if cancer is proven to be present.\\n\\nScreening programmes are effective for some but not all cancer types and in general are far more complex and resource-intensive than early diagnosis as they require special equipment and dedicated personnel. Even when screening programmes are established,\\n    early diagnosis programmes are still necessary to identify those cancer cases occurring in people who do not meet the age or risk factor criteria for screening.\\n\\nPatient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies. Examples of screening methods are:\\n\\nHPV test (including HPV DNA and mRNA test), as preferred modality for cervical cancer screening; and\\n\\nmammography screening for breast cancer for women aged 50–69 residing in settings with strong or relatively strong health systems.\\n\\nQuality assurance is required for both screening and early diagnosis programmes.\\n\\nTreatment', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer', 'title': 'Cancer', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on cancer providing key facts and information on figures, causes, risk factors, prevention, early diagnosis, \\ntreatment, palliative care, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=\"Patient selection for screening programmes is based on age and risk factors to avoid excessive false positive studies.

Treatment usually includes surgery, radiotherapy, and/or systemic therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal treatments,\\n    targeted biological therapies). Proper selection of a treatment regimen takes into consideration both the cancer and the individual being treated. Completion of the treatment protocol in a defined period of time is important to achieve the predicted\\n    therapeutic result.\\n\\nDetermining the goals of treatment is an important first step. The primary goal is generally to cure cancer or to considerably prolong life. Improving the patient's quality of life is also an important goal.

TB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment.\\n\\nIn certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB. The vaccine prevents TB outside of the lungs but not in the lungs.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nPeople with latent TB infection don’t feel sick and aren’t contagious. Only a small proportion of people who get infected with TB will get TB disease and symptoms. Babies and children are at higher risk.\\n\\nCertain conditions can increase a person’s risk for tuberculosis disease:\\n\\ndiabetes (high blood sugar)\\n\\nweakened immune system (for example, HIV or AIDS)\\n\\nbeing malnourished\\n\\ntobacco use.\\n\\nUnlike TB infection, when a person gets TB disease, they will have symptoms.

These tests have high diagnostic accuracy and will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB.\\n\\nA tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferongamma release assay (IGRA) can be used to identity people with infection.\\n\\nDiagnosing multidrug-resistant and other resistant forms of TB (see multidrug-resistant TB section below) as well as HIV-associated TB can be complex and expensive.\\n\\nTuberculosis is particularly difficult to diagnose in children.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nTuberculosis disease is treated with antibiotics.

It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice. This can allow TB that is still alive to become resistant to the drugs.\\n\\nTuberculosis that doesn’t respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires more toxic treatment with different medicines.\\n\\nMultidrug-resistant TB\\n\\nDrug resistance emerges when TB medicines are used inappropriately, through incorrect prescription by health care providers, poor quality drugs, or patients stopping treatment prematurely.\\n\\nMultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most effective first-line TB drugs. MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using second-line drugs. However, second-line treatment options require extensive medicines that are expensive and toxic.\\n\\nIn some cases, more extensive drug resistance can develop. TB caused by bacteria that do not respond to the most effective second-line TB drugs can leave patients with very limited treatment options.\\n\\nMDR-TB remains a public health crisis and a health security threat.

The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. In the past, MDR-TB treatment used to last for at least 9 months and up to 20 months. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens.\\n\\nTB and HIV\\n\\nPeople living with HIV are 16 (uncertainty interval 14–18) times more likely to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV.\\n\\nHIV and TB form a lethal combination, each speeding the other's progress. Without proper treatment, 60% of HIV-negative people with TB on average and nearly all HIV-positive people with TB will die. In 2022, about 167\\xa0000 people died of HIV-associated TB. The percentage of notified TB patients who had a documented HIV test result in 2022 was 80%, up from 76% in 2021. The WHO African Region has the highest burden of HIV-associated TB. Overall in 2022, only 54% of TB patients known to be living with HIV were on antiretroviral therapy (ART).\\n\\nWHO recommends a 12-component approach of collaborative TB-HIV activities, including actions for prevention and treatment of infection and disease, to reduce deaths.\\n\\nImpact\\n\\nTuberculosis mostly affects adults in their most productive years.

However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries.\\n\\nTB occurs in every part of the world. In 2022, the largest number of new TB cases occurred in WHO’s South-East Asian Region (46%), followed by the African Region (23%) and the Western Pacific (18%). Around 87% of new TB cases occurred in the 30 high TB burden countries, with more than two-thirds of the global total in Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the Philippines. Globally, about 50% of TB patients and their households face total costs (direct medical expenditures, non-medical expenditures and indirect costs such as income losses) that are catastrophic (>20% of total household income), far from the WHO End TB Strategy target of zero. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, undernutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill. Globally in 2022, there were 2.2\\xa0million new TB cases that were attributable to undernutrition, 0.89\\xa0million to HIV infection, 0.73\\xa0million to alcohol use disorders, 0.70\\xa0million to smoking and 0.37\\xa0million to diabetes.\\n\\nInvestments to end TB\\n\\nUS$\\xa013\\xa0billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets agreed on at the UN high level-TB meeting.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis', 'title': 'Tuberculosis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on tuberculosis (TB): includes key facts, definition, global impact, treatment, HIV and TB, multidrug-resistant TB and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Investments to end TB\\n\\nUS$\\xa013\\xa0billion are needed annually for TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care to achieve global targets agreed on at the UN high level-TB meeting.\\n\\nAs in the past decade, most of the spending on TB services in 2022 (80%) was from domestic sources.

(measured by disability-adjusted life years)\\n\\nTobacco smoking accounts for over 70% of COPD cases in high-income countries. In LMIC tobacco smoking accounts for 30–40% of COPD cases, and household air pollution is a major risk factor.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease causing restricted airflow and breathing problems. It is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis.\\n\\nIn people with COPD, the lungs can get damaged or clogged with phlegm. Symptoms include cough, sometimes with phlegm, difficulty breathing, wheezing and tiredness.\\n\\nSmoking and air pollution are the most common causes of COPD. People with COPD are at higher risk of other health problems.\\n\\nCOPD is not curable but symptoms can improve if one avoids smoking and exposure to air pollution and gets vaccines to prevent infections. It can also be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe most common symptoms of COPD are difficulty breathing, chronic cough (sometimes with phlegm) and feeling tired.\\n\\nCOPD symptoms can get worse quickly. These are called flare-ups. These usually last for a few days and often require additional medicine.\\n\\nPeople with COPD also have a higher risk for other health problems. These include:\\n\\nlung infections, like the flu or pneumonia\\n\\nlung cancer\\n\\nheart problems\\n\\nweak muscles and brittle bones\\n\\ndepression and anxiety.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-(copd)', 'title': 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) provides key facts and information on symptoms, diagnosis and treatment, risk factors and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Symptoms\\n\\nThe most common symptoms of COPD are difficulty breathing, chronic cough (sometimes with phlegm) and feeling tired.\\n\\nCOPD symptoms can get worse quickly.

These include:\\n\\nlung infections, like the flu or pneumonia\\n\\nlung cancer\\n\\nheart problems\\n\\nweak muscles and brittle bones\\n\\ndepression and anxiety.\\n\\nCommon symptoms of COPD develop from mid-life onwards. As COPD progresses, people find it more difficult to carry out their normal daily activities, often due to breathlessness. There may be a considerable financial burden due to limitation of workplace and home productivity, and costs of medical treatment.\\n\\nCOPD is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema usually refers to destruction of the tiny air sacs at the end of the airways in the lungs. Chronic bronchitis refers to a chronic cough with the production of phlegm resulting from inflammation in the airways.\\xa0COPD and asthma share common symptoms (cough, wheeze and difficulty breathing) and people may have both conditions.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nSeveral processes can cause the airways to become narrow and lead to COPD. There may be destruction of parts of the lung, mucus blocking the airways, and inflammation and swelling of the airway lining.\\n\\nCOPD develops gradually over time, often resulting from a combination of risk factors:\\n\\ntobacco exposure from active      smoking or passive exposure to second-hand smoke;\\n\\noccupational exposure to      dusts, fumes or chemicals;\\n\\nindoor air pollution:      biomass fuel (wood, animal dung, crop residue) or coal is frequently used      for cooking and heating in low- and middle-income countries with high      levels of smoke exposure;\\n\\nearly life events such as      poor growth in utero, prematurity, and frequent or severe respiratory      infections in childhood that prevent maximum lung growth;', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-(copd)', 'title': 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) provides key facts and information on symptoms, diagnosis and treatment, risk factors and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='occupational exposure to      dusts, fumes or chemicals;\\n\\nindoor air pollution:      biomass fuel (wood, animal dung, crop residue) or coal is frequently used      for cooking and heating in low- and middle-income countries with high      levels of smoke exposure;\\n\\nearly life events such as      poor growth in utero, prematurity, and frequent or severe respiratory      infections in childhood that prevent maximum lung growth;\\n\\nasthma in childhood; and\\n\\na rare genetic condition      called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which can cause COPD at a young      age.\\n\\nCOPD should be suspected if a person has typical symptoms, and the diagnosis confirmed by a breathing test called spirometry, which measures how the lungs are working. In low- and middle-income countries, spirometry is often not available and so the diagnosis may be missed.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nCOPD isn’t curable, but it can get better by not smoking, avoiding air pollution and getting vaccines. It can be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation.\\n\\nThere are several treatments available for COPD.\\n\\nInhaled medicines that open and reduce swelling in the airways are the main treatments.\\n\\nBronchodilator inhalers are the most important medicines for treating COPD. They relax the airways to keep them open.\\n\\nShort-acting bronchodilators start to work in seconds and can last for 4–6 hours. These are often used during flare-ups.\\n\\nLong-acting bronchodilators take longer to start working but last longer. These are taken daily and can be combined with inhaled steroids.\\n\\nOther treatments may also be used:\\n\\nSteroid pills and antibiotics are often used to treat flare-ups.\\n\\nOxygen is used for people who have had COPD for a long time or have severe COPD.\\n\\nPulmonary rehabilitation teaches exercises to improve your breathing and ability to exercise.\\n\\nSurgery may improve symptoms for some people with severe COPD.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-(copd)', 'title': 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) provides key facts and information on symptoms, diagnosis and treatment, risk factors and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Long-acting bronchodilators take longer to start working but last longer.

Inhaled corticosteroids are sometimes given in combination with these to reduce inflammation in the lungs.\\n\\nInhalers must be taken using the correct technique, and in some cases with a spacer device to help deliver the medication into the airways more effectively. Access to inhalers is limited in many low- and middle-income countries; in 2021 salbutamol inhalers were generally available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries.\\n\\nFlare-ups are often caused by a respiratory infection, and people may be given an antibiotic or steroid tablets in addition to inhaled or nebulised treatment as needed.\\n\\nLiving with COPD\\n\\nLifestyle changes can help improve symptoms of COPD.\\n\\nQuit smoking or vaping. This is the most important thing to do. Even if you have been smoking for many years, quitting can still help.\\n\\nAvoid second-hand smoke or smoke from indoor cooking fires.\\n\\nStay physically active.\\n\\nProtect yourself from lung infections:\\n\\nGet a flu vaccine every year.\\n\\nGet the pneumonia vaccine.\\n\\nGet all available COVID-19 vaccines and make sure you have had the latest boosters.\\n\\nPeople living with COPD must be given information about their condition, treatment and self-care to help them to stay as active and healthy as possible.\\n\\nWHO response', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-(copd)', 'title': 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) provides key facts and information on symptoms, diagnosis and treatment, risk factors and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Avoid second-hand smoke or smoke from indoor cooking fires.\\n\\nStay physically active.\\n\\nProtect yourself from lung infections:\\n\\nGet a flu vaccine every year.\\n\\nGet the pneumonia vaccine.\\n\\nGet all available COVID-19 vaccines and make sure you have had the latest boosters.\\n\\nPeople living with COPD must be given information about their condition, treatment and self-care to help them to stay as active and healthy as possible.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nCOPD is included in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\\n\\nWHO is taking action to extend diagnosis of and treatment for COPD in a number of ways.\\n\\nThe WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) was developed to help improve NCD management in primary health care in low-resource settings.

Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.\\n\\nIn 2014, 8.5% of adults aged 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years. Another 460 000 kidney disease deaths were caused by diabetes, and raised blood glucose causes around 20% of cardiovascular deaths (1).\\n\\nBetween 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes. In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes', 'title': 'Diabetes', 'description': 'Diabetes factsheet from WHO providing key facts and information on types of diabetes, symptoms, common consequences, economic impact, diagnosis and treatment, WHO response.

In lower-middle-income countries, the mortality rate due to diabetes increased 13%.\\n\\nBy contrast, the probability of dying from any one of the four main noncommunicable diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases or diabetes) between the ages of 30 and 70 decreased by 22% globally between 2000 and 2019.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of diabetes may occur suddenly. In type 2 diabetes, the symptoms can be mild and may take many years to be noticed.\\n\\nSymptoms of diabetes include:\\n\\nfeeling very thirsty\\n\\nneeding to urinate more often than usual\\n\\nblurred vision\\n\\nfeeling tired\\n\\nlosing weight unintentionally\\n\\nOver time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves.\\n\\nPeople with diabetes have a higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure.\\n\\nDiabetes can cause permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes.\\n\\nMany people with diabetes develop problems with their feet from nerve damage and poor blood flow. This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation.\\n\\nType 1 diabetes\\n\\nType 1 diabetes (previously known as insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset) is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. In 2017 there were 9 million people with type 1 diabetes; the majority of them live in high-income countries.\\xa0Neither its cause nor the means to prevent it are known.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes\\n\\nType 2 diabetes affects how your body uses sugar (glucose) for energy. It stops the body from using insulin properly, which can lead to high levels of blood sugar if not treated.\\n\\nOver time, type 2 diabetes can cause serious damage to the body, especially nerves and blood vessels.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes is often preventable.

They may take several years to be noticed. \\xa0Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen.\\n\\nMore than 95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes.

It results from the interaction between health conditions such as dementia, blindness or spinal cord injury, and a range of environmental and personal factors. An estimated 1.3 billion people – or 16% of the global population – experience a significant disability today. This number is growing because of an increase in noncommunicable diseases and people living longer. Persons with disabilities are a diverse group, and factors such as sex, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, race, ethnicity and their economic situation affect their experiences in life and their health needs. Persons with disabilities die earlier, have poorer health, and experience more limitations in everyday functioning than others.\\n\\nFactors contributing to health inequities\\n\\nHealth inequities arise from unfair conditions faced by persons with disabilities.\\n\\nStructural factors: Persons with disabilities experience ableism, stigma and discrimination in all facets of life, which affects their physical and mental health. Laws and policies may deny them the right to make their own decisions and allow a range of harmful practices in the health sector, such as forced sterilization, involuntary admission and treatment, and even institutionalization.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health', 'title': 'Disability', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on disability and health provides key facts and information on unmet needs for health care, secondary conditions, how lives of disabled people affected, barriers to health care and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Health inequities arise from unfair conditions faced by persons with disabilities.\\n\\nStructural factors: Persons with disabilities experience ableism, stigma and discrimination in all facets of life, which affects their physical and mental health. Laws and policies may deny them the right to make their own decisions and allow a range of harmful practices in the health sector, such as forced sterilization, involuntary admission and treatment, and even institutionalization.\\n\\nSocial determinants of health: Poverty, exclusion from education and employment, and poor living conditions all add to the risk of poor health and unmet health care needs among persons with disabilities. Gaps in formal social support mechanisms mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on support from family members to engage in health and community activities, which not only disadvantages them but also their caregivers (who are mostly women and girls).\\n\\nRisk factors: Persons with disabilities are more likely to have risk factors for non-communicable diseases, such as smoking, poor diet, alcohol consumption and a lack of physical activity. A key reason for this is that they are often left out of public health interventions.\\n\\nHealth system: Persons with disabilities face barriers in all aspects of the health system. For example, a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes and discriminatory practices among healthcare workers; inaccessible health facilities and information; and lack of information or data collection and analysis on disability, all contribute to health inequities faced by this group.\\n\\nInternational frameworks\\n\\nCountries have an obligation under international human rights law, and in some cases domestic laws, to address the health inequities faced by persons with disabilities. There are two important international frameworks which relate to health equity for persons with disabilities.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health', 'title': 'Disability', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on disability and health provides key facts and information on unmet needs for health care, secondary conditions, how lives of disabled people affected, barriers to health care and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='International frameworks\\n\\nCountries have an obligation under international human rights law, and in some cases domestic laws, to address the health inequities faced by persons with disabilities. There are two important international frameworks which relate to health equity for persons with disabilities.\\n\\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires States Parties to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to the same range, quality and standard of free or affordable health care as other people.\\n\\nThe World Health Assembly Resolution WHA74.8 on the highest attainable standard of health for persons with disabilities calls for Member States to ensure that persons with disabilities receive effective health services as part of universal health coverage; equal protection during emergencies; and equal access to cross-sectoral public health interventions.\\n\\nAchieving health for all\\n\\nDisability inclusion is critical to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and global health priorities to achieve health for all.\\n\\nUniversal health coverage will not be achieved if persons with disabilities do not receive quality health services on an equal basis with others. Investing in universal health coverage for persons with disabilities will benefit not only individuals but also communities.\\n\\nThere could be almost an US$ 10 return for every US$ 1 spent on implementing disability inclusive prevention and care for noncommunicable diseases.\\n\\nPersons with disabilities must be considered when preventing and responding to health emergencies because they are more likely to be affected, both directly and indirectly. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, persons with disabilities living in institutions have been “cut off from the rest of society” with reports of residents being overmedicated, sedated, or locked up, and examples of self-harm also occurring (1).', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health', 'title': 'Disability', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on disability and health provides key facts and information on unmet needs for health care, secondary conditions, how lives of disabled people affected, barriers to health care and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Persons with disabilities must be considered when preventing and responding to health emergencies because they are more likely to be affected, both directly and indirectly.

There are three things that all governments and health sector partners can do. First, they must consider health equity for persons with disabilities in all health sector actions. Second, they can include persons with disabilities in decision-making processes. Third, they can monitor how persons with disabilities are being reached and benefitting from health sector actions.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nWHO works to ensure persons with disabilities have equitable access to effective health services; are included in health emergencies preparedness and responses; and can access cross-sectoral public health interventions to  achieve the highest attainable standard of health.

In at least 1 billion of these, vision impairment could have been prevented or is yet to be addressed.\\n\\nThe leading causes of vision impairment and blindness at a global level are refractive errors and cataracts.\\n\\nIt is estimated that globally only 36% of people with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error and only 17% of people with vision impairment due to cataract have received access to an appropriate intervention.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment', 'title': 'Blindness and vision impairment', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on blindness and visual impairment providing key facts, definitions, causes, who is at risk, global and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='The leading causes of vision impairment and blindness at a global level are refractive errors and cataracts.\\n\\nIt is estimated that globally only 36% of people with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error and only 17% of people with vision impairment due to cataract have received access to an appropriate intervention.\\n\\nVision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden, with the annual global cost of productivity estimated to be US$ 411 billion.\\n\\nVision loss can affect people of all ages; however, most people with vision impairment and blindness are over the age of 50 years.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nVision, the most dominant of our senses, plays a critical role in every facet and stage of our lives. We take vision for granted, but without vision, we struggle to learn, to walk, to read, to participate in school and to work.\\n\\nVision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual system and its vision functions. Everyone, if they live long enough, will experience at least one eye condition in their lifetime that will require appropriate care.\\n\\nVision impairment has serious consequences for the individual across the life course. Many of these consequences can be mitigated by timely access to quality eye care. Eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness – such as cataract or refractive error – are, for good reasons, the main focus of eye care strategies; nevertheless, the importance of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment – such as dry eye or conjunctivitis – must not be overlooked. These conditions are frequently among the leading reasons for presentation to eye care services.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nGlobally, the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness are:\\n\\nrefractive errors\\n\\ncataract\\n\\ndiabetic retinopathy\\n\\nglaucoma\\n\\nage-related macular degeneration.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment', 'title': 'Blindness and vision impairment', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on blindness and visual impairment providing key facts, definitions, causes, who is at risk, global and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Causes\\n\\nGlobally, the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness are:\\n\\nrefractive errors\\n\\ncataract\\n\\ndiabetic retinopathy\\n\\nglaucoma\\n\\nage-related macular degeneration.\\n\\nThere is substantial variation in the causes of vision impairment between and within countries according to the availability of eye care services, their affordability, and the education of the population. For example, the proportion of vision impairment attributable to unoperated cataract is higher in low- and middle-income countries. In high income countries, diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration are more common.\\n\\nAmong children, congenital cataract is a leading cause of vision impairment in low-income countries, whereas in middle-income countries it is more likely to be retinopathy of prematurity.\\n\\nUncorrected refractive error remains a leading cause of vision impairment in all countries amongst children and adult populations.\\n\\nPrevalence\\n\\nGlobally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment. In at least 1 billion – or almost half – of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.\\n\\nAmong this 1 billion people, the main conditions causing distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract (94 million), refractive error (88.4 million), age-related macular degeneration (8 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million) (1). The main condition causing near vision impairment is presbyopia (826 million)\\xa0(2).', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment', 'title': 'Blindness and vision impairment', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on blindness and visual impairment providing key facts, definitions, causes, who is at risk, global and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Among this 1 billion people, the main conditions causing distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract (94 million), refractive error (88.4 million), age-related macular degeneration (8 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million) (1). The main condition causing near vision impairment is presbyopia (826 million)\\xa0(2).\\n\\nIn terms of regional differences, the prevalence of distance vision impairment in low- and middle-income regions is estimated to be 4 times higher than in high-income regions (1). With regards to near vision, rates of unaddressed near vision impairment are estimated to be greater than 80% in western, eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, while comparative rates in high-income regions of North America, Australasia, western Europe, and of Asia-Pacific are reported to be lower than 10% (2).\\n\\nPopulation growth and ageing are expected to increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment.\\n\\nImpact of vision impairment\\n\\nPersonal impact\\n\\nYoung children with early onset irreversible severe vision impairment can experience delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development, with lifelong consequences. School-age children with vision impairment can also experience lower levels of educational achievement.\\n\\nVision impairment severely impacts quality of life among adult populations. Adults with vision impairment can experience lower rates of employment and higher rates of depression and anxiety.\\n\\nIn the case of older adults, vision impairment can contribute to social isolation, difficulty walking, a higher risk of falls and fractures, and a greater likelihood of early entry into nursing or care homes.\\n\\nEconomic impact', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment', 'title': 'Blindness and vision impairment', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on blindness and visual impairment providing key facts, definitions, causes, who is at risk, global and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Vision impairment severely impacts quality of life among adult populations.

This figure far outweighs the estimated cost gap of addressing the unmet need of vision impairment (estimated at about US$ 25 billion).\\n\\nStrategies to address eye conditions to avoid vision impairment\\n\\nThere are effective interventions covering promotion, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation which address the needs associated with eye conditions and vision impairment. While many vision loss cases can be prevented (such as those due to infections, trauma, unsafe traditional medicines, perinatal diseases, nutrition-related diseases, unsafe use or self-administration of topical treatment), this is not possible for all. For many eye conditions, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, early detection and timely treatment are crucial to avoid irreversible vision loss. Spectacle correction for refractive error and surgery for cataract are among the most cost-effective of all health-care interventions. Yet, globally only 36% of people with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error have received access to an appropriate pair of spectacles and only 17% of people with vision impairment or blindness due to cataract have received access to quality surgery.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment', 'title': 'Blindness and vision impairment', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on blindness and visual impairment providing key facts, definitions, causes, who is at risk, global and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Treatment is also available for many eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment, such as dry eye, conjunctivitis and blepharitis, but generate discomfort and pain. Treatment of these conditions is directed at alleviating the symptoms and preventing the evolution towards more severe stages of those diseases.\\n\\nVision rehabilitation is very effective in improving functioning for people with an irreversible vision loss that can be caused by eye conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, consequences of trauma, and age-related macular degeneration.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nWHO’s work is guided by the recommendations of the\\xa0WHO World report on vision (2019)\\xa0and the resolution on\\xa0\"integrated, people-centred eye care, including preventable blindness and vision impairment\"\\xa0adopted at the Seventy-third World Health Assembly in 2020.

universal health coverage.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nAsthma is a chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the airways, which makes it harder to breathe.\\n\\nSymptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. These symptoms can be mild or severe and can come and go over time.\\n\\nAlthough asthma can be a serious condition, it can be managed with the right treatment. People with symptoms of asthma should speak to a health professional.\\n\\nImpact\\n\\nAsthma is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\\n\\nPeople with under-treated asthma can suffer sleep disturbance, tiredness during the day, and poor concentration. Asthma sufferers and their families may miss school and work, with financial impact on the family and wider community. If symptoms are severe, people with asthma may need to receive emergency health care and they may be admitted to hospital for treatment and monitoring. In the most severe cases, asthma can lead to death.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of asthma can vary from person to person. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse. This is known as an asthma attack.\\xa0Symptoms are often worse at night or during exercise.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma', 'title': 'Asthma', 'description': 'WHO factsheet on asthma providing key facts, causes, reducing the burden, prevention and control.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of asthma can vary from person to person. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse. This is known as an asthma attack.\\xa0Symptoms are often worse at night or during exercise.\\n\\nCommon symptoms of asthma include:\\n\\na persistent cough, especially at night\\n\\nwheezing when exhaling and sometimes when inhaling\\n\\nshortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sometimes even when resting\\n\\nchest tightness, making it difficult to breathe deeply.\\n\\nSome people will have worse symptoms when they have a cold or during changes in the weather. Other triggers can include dust, smoke, fumes, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers, strong soaps and perfume.\\n\\nSymptoms can be caused by other conditions as well. People with symptoms should talk to a healthcare provider.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\nMany factors have been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma, although it is often difficult to find a single, direct cause.\\n\\nAsthma is more likely if other family members also have asthma – particularly      a close relative, such as a parent or sibling.\\n\\nAsthma is more likely in people who have other allergic conditions,      such as eczema and rhinitis (hay fever).\\n\\nUrbanization is associated with increased asthma prevalence,      probably due to multiple lifestyle factors.\\n\\nEvents in early life affect the developing lungs and can increase      the risk of asthma. These include low birth weight, prematurity, exposure      to tobacco smoke and other sources of air pollution, as well as viral      respiratory infections.\\n\\nExposure to a range of environmental allergens and irritants are      also thought to increase the risk of asthma, including indoor and outdoor      air pollution, house dust mites, moulds, and occupational exposure to      chemicals, fumes or dust.\\n\\nChildren and adults who are overweight or obese are at a greater      risk of asthma.\\n\\nTreatment', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma', 'title': 'Asthma', 'description': 'WHO factsheet on asthma providing key facts, causes, reducing the burden, prevention and control.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Exposure to a range of environmental allergens and irritants are      also thought to increase the risk of asthma, including indoor and outdoor      air pollution, house dust mites, moulds, and occupational exposure to      chemicals, fumes or dust.\\n\\nChildren and adults who are overweight or obese are at a greater      risk of asthma.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nAsthma cannot be cured but there are several treatments available. The most common treatment is to use an inhaler, which delivers medication directly to the lungs.\\n\\nInhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life.\\n\\nThere are two main types of inhaler:\\n\\nbronchodilators (such      as salbutamol), that open the air passages and relieve symptoms; and\\n\\nsteroids (such as beclometasone)      that reduce inflammation in the air passages, which improves asthma      symptoms and reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks and death.\\n\\nPeople with asthma may need to use their inhaler every day. Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available.\\n\\nUsing an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers.\\n\\nAccess to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.\\n\\nIt is also important to raise community awareness to reduce the myths and stigma associated with asthma in some settings.\\n\\nSelf-care', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma', 'title': 'Asthma', 'description': 'WHO factsheet on asthma providing key facts, causes, reducing the burden, prevention and control.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Access to inhalers is a problem in many countries.

This includes their treatment options, triggers to avoid, and how to manage their symptoms at home.\\n\\nIt is important for people with asthma to know how to increase their treatment when their symptoms are worsening to avoid a serious attack. Healthcare providers may give an asthma action plan to help people with asthma to take greater control of their treatment.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nAsthma is included in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\\n\\nWHO is taking action to extend diagnosis of and treatment for asthma in a number of ways.\\n\\nThe WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) was developed to help improve NCD management in primary health care in low-resource settings. PEN includes protocols for the assessment, diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and modules on healthy lifestyle counselling, including tobacco cessation and self-care.\\n\\nReducing tobacco smoke exposure is important for both primary prevention of asthma and disease management. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is enabling progress in this area as are WHO initiatives such as MPOWER and mTobacco Cessation.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma', 'title': 'Asthma', 'description': 'WHO factsheet on asthma providing key facts, causes, reducing the burden, prevention and control.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=\"Reducing tobacco smoke exposure is important for both primary prevention of asthma and disease management.

WHO has developed training for health care workers on air pollution which highlights this link and offers practical advice to reduce and mitigate exposure. \\xa0The Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD) contributes to WHO’s work to prevent and control chronic respiratory diseases.

Around 1 in 6 people who get this type of meningitis die and 1 in 5 have severe complications.\\n\\nSafe affordable vaccines are the most effective way to deliver long-lasting protection.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nMeningitis is the inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by infection. It can be fatal and requires immediate medical care.\\n\\nMeningitis can be caused by several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Most infections can be transmitted from person to person. Injuries, cancers and drugs cause a small number of cases.\\n\\nBacterial meningitis is the most common dangerous type of meningitis and can be fatal within 24 hours.\\n\\nMeningitis can affect people of any age.\\n\\nThere are effective treatments and vaccines against some of the main bacterial causes of meningitis. However, meningitis remains a significant threat around the world.\\n\\nThere are four main causes of acute bacterial meningitis:\\n\\nNeisseria meningitidis (meningococcus)\\n\\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)\\n\\nHaemophilus influenzae\\n\\nStreptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus)\\n\\nThese bacteria are responsible for more than half of the deaths from meningitis globally and they cause other severe diseases like sepsis and pneumonia.\\n\\nOther bacteria e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, viruses such as enteroviruses and mumps, fungi, especially Cryptococcus, and parasites like Amoeba are also important causes of meningitis.\\n\\nWho is at risk?', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis', 'title': 'Meningitis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on meningitis provides key facts and information on transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, outbreaks trends and public health response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Haemophilus influenzae\\n\\nStreptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus)\\n\\nThese bacteria are responsible for more than half of the deaths from meningitis globally and they cause other severe diseases like sepsis and pneumonia.\\n\\nOther bacteria e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, viruses such as enteroviruses and mumps, fungi, especially Cryptococcus, and parasites like Amoeba are also important causes of meningitis.\\n\\nWho is at risk?\\n\\nAlthough meningitis affects all ages, young children are most at risk. Newborn babies are at most risk from Group B streptococcus, young children are at higher risk from meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. Adolescents and young adults are at particular risk of meningococcal disease while the elderly are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease.\\n\\nPeople all over the world are at risk of meningitis. The highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African Meningitis Belt, especially recognised to be at high risk of epidemics of meningococcal but also pneumococcal meningitis.\\n\\nHigher risk is seen when people are living in close proximity, for example at mass gatherings, in refugee camps, in overcrowded households or in student, military and other occupational settings. Immune deficiencies such as HIV infection or complement deficiency, immunosuppression, and active or passive smoking can also raise the risk of different types of meningitis.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nThe route of transmission varies by organism. Most bacteria that cause meningitis such as meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae are carried in the human nose and throat. They spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or throat secretions. Group B streptococcus is often carried in the human gut or vagina and can spread from mother to child around the time of birth.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis', 'title': 'Meningitis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on meningitis provides key facts and information on transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, outbreaks trends and public health response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Transmission\\n\\nThe route of transmission varies by organism. Most bacteria that cause meningitis such as meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae are carried in the human nose and throat. They spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or throat secretions. Group B streptococcus is often carried in the human gut or vagina and can spread from mother to child around the time of birth.\\n\\nCarriage of these organisms is usually harmless and helps build up immunity against infection, but the bacteria occasionally invade the body causing meningitis and sepsis.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nClinical features of patients with meningitis vary depending on the cause, disease course (acute, subacute or chronic), brain involvement (meningo-encephalitis) and systemic complications (e.g., sepsis).\\n\\nCommon symptoms of meningitis are neck stiffness, fever, confusion or altered mental status, headaches, nausea and vomiting.\\n\\nLess frequent symptoms are seizures, coma and neurological deficits (for example hearing or vision loss, cognitive impairment, or weakness of the limbs).\\n\\nTypes of meningitis caused by viruses or bacteria can have similar symptoms. Symptoms may be stronger in some types of meningitis than in others and require different treatment.\\n\\nBacterial meningitis pathogens can cause other symptoms as a result of bloodstream infections (septicaemia), which can quickly lead to sepsis, including:\\n\\ncold hands and feet\\n\\njoint and muscle pains\\n\\nbreathing faster than usual\\n\\ndiarrhoea\\n\\ndark purple or red rash.\\n\\nBabies sometimes have different symptoms than adults:\\n\\nbeing less active and difficult to wake\\n\\nbeing irritable or inconsolable\\n\\npoor feeding\\n\\nstiff or floppy body\\n\\nswelling in the soft spot in their head (fontanelle).\\n\\nComplications and sequelae', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis', 'title': 'Meningitis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on meningitis provides key facts and information on transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, outbreaks trends and public health response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='cold hands and feet\\n\\njoint and muscle pains\\n\\nbreathing faster than usual\\n\\ndiarrhoea\\n\\ndark purple or red rash.\\n\\nBabies sometimes have different symptoms than adults:\\n\\nbeing less active and difficult to wake\\n\\nbeing irritable or inconsolable\\n\\npoor feeding\\n\\nstiff or floppy body\\n\\nswelling in the soft spot in their head (fontanelle).\\n\\nComplications and sequelae\\n\\nOne in 5 people surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis may have long lasting after-effects. These after-effects include hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness, difficulties with vision, speech, language, memory, and communication, as well as scarring and limb amputations after sepsis.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nVaccines offer the best protection against common types of bacterial meningitis.\\n\\nVaccines can prevent meningitis caused by:\\n\\nmeningococcus\\n\\npneumococcus\\n\\nhaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).\\n\\nBacterial and viral meningitis can spread from person to person. If you live with someone who has either type of meningitis, you should:\\n\\nTalk to your doctor or nurse about taking antibiotics (in case of bacterial meningitis)\\n\\nWash hands frequently, especially before eating\\n\\nAvoid close contact and sharing cups, utensils or toothbrushes.\\n\\nLicensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae disease have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. No universal vaccine exists.\\n\\nIn the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80–85% of meningitis epidemics before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass preventive campaigns (since 2010) and into routine immunization programmes (since 2016).

Continuing introduction into routine immunization programmes and maintaining high coverage is critical to avoid the resurgence of epidemics.\\n\\n2. Antibiotics for prevention (chemoprophylaxis)\\n\\nAntibiotics for close contacts of those with meningococcal disease, when given promptly, decreases the risk of transmission. Outside the African meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts within the household. Within the meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis for close contacts is recommended in non-epidemic situations. Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice, and ceftriaxone an alternative.\\n\\nIdentifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal disease is recommended in many countries. Mothers at risk are offered intravenous penicillin during labour to prevent their babies developing Group B streptococcal infection.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nInitial diagnosis of meningitis can be made by clinical examination followed by a lumbar puncture. The bacteria can sometimes be seen in microscopic examinations of the spinal fluid. The diagnosis is supported or confirmed by growing the bacteria from specimens of cerebrospinal fluid or blood, by rapid diagnostic tests or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The identification of the serogroups and susceptibility to antibiotics are important to define control measures. Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing identify more differences between strains and inform public health responses.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nMeningitis is a medical emergency.\\n\\nMeningitis is potentially fatal within 24 hours and requires urgent medical attention. It usually cannot be safely cared for at home.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis', 'title': 'Meningitis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on meningitis provides key facts and information on transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, outbreaks trends and public health response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Treatment\\n\\nMeningitis is a medical emergency.\\n\\nMeningitis is potentially fatal within 24 hours and requires urgent medical attention. It usually cannot be safely cared for at home.\\n\\nMeningitis caused by viruses or bacteria can have similar symptoms. Meningitis can vary in severity, appropriate treatment and care depending on the cause. Meningitis caused by bacteria requires immediate antibiotic treatment.\\n\\nAny person who shows signs or symptoms or meningitis should seek immediate care at a hospital or health centre. This will verify if a person has meningitis, confirm the cause of infection and determine the right treatment and care.\\n\\nMeningitis sequelae can have an enormous impact on individuals, families and communities, both financially and emotionally. Sometimes, complications such as deafness, learning impairment or behavioural problems are not recognized by carers and healthcare workers and therefore go untreated.\\n\\nThose who have lived through meningitis often have health-care needs requiring long-term medical treatments. The ongoing psychosocial impacts of disability from meningitis can have medical, educational, social and human rights-based implications. Despite the high burden of meningitis sequelae on people with meningitis, their families and the community, access to both services and support for these conditions is often insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Individuals and families with members disabled by meningitis should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national Organizations of Disabled People (ODPs) and other disability focused organizations, which can\\xa0provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure people disabled by meningitis are able to live full and rewarding lives.\\n\\nSurveillance\\n\\nSurveillance, from case detection to investigation and laboratory confirmation is essential to the control of meningitis.

vaccinated children under the age of 5 years.\\n\\nThe proportion of children receiving a first dose of measles vaccine was 83% in 2023, well below the 2019 level of 86%.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death.\\n\\nMeasles can affect anyone but is most common in children.\\n\\nMeasles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body.\\n\\nBeing vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.\\n\\nBefore the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6\\xa0million deaths each year.\\n\\nAn estimated 136\\xa0000 people died from measles in 2022 – mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine.\\n\\nAccelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 57\\xa0million deaths between 2000–2022. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 761\\xa0000 in 2000 to 136\\xa0000 in 2022 (1).\\n\\nEffects of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to setbacks in surveillance and immunization efforts. The suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles', 'title': 'Measles', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on measles providing key fact, signs and symptoms, who is at risk, treatment, prevention, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to setbacks in surveillance and immunization efforts. The suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles.\\n\\nNo country is exempt from measles, and areas with low immunization encourage the virus to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated children at risk.\\n\\nWe must regain progress and achieve regional measles elimination targets, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunization programs should be strengthened within primary healthcare, so efforts to reach all children with two measles vaccine doses should be accelerated. Countries should also implement robust surveillance systems to identify and close immunity gaps.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of measles usually begin 10–14 days after exposure to the virus. A prominent rash is the most visible symptom.\\n\\nEarly symptoms usually last 4–7 days. They include:\\n\\nrunning nose\\n\\ncough\\n\\nred and watery eyes\\n\\nsmall white spots inside the cheeks.\\n\\nThe rash begins about 7–18 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over about 3 days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts 5–6 days before fading.\\n\\nMost deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease.\\n\\nComplications can include:\\n\\nblindness\\n\\nencephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage)\\n\\nsevere diarrhoea and related dehydration\\n\\near infections\\n\\nsevere breathing problems including pneumonia.\\n\\nIf a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles', 'title': 'Measles', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on measles providing key fact, signs and symptoms, who is at risk, treatment, prevention, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Most deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease.\\n\\nComplications can include:\\n\\nblindness\\n\\nencephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage)\\n\\nsevere diarrhoea and related dehydration\\n\\near infections\\n\\nsevere breathing problems including pneumonia.\\n\\nIf a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight.\\n\\nComplications are most common in children under 5 years and adults over age 30. They are more likely in children who are malnourished, especially those without enough vitamin A or with a weak immune system from HIV or other diseases. Measles itself also weakens the immune system and can make the body “forget” how to protect itself against infections, leaving children extremely vulnerable.\\n\\nWho is at risk?\\n\\nAny non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe measles complications.\\n\\nMeasles is still common, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The overwhelming majority of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes or weak health infrastructures that struggle to reach all children with immunization.\\n\\nDamaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection. Children with malnutrition or other causes of a weak immune system are at highest risk of death from measles.\\n\\nTransmission', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles', 'title': 'Measles', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on measles providing key fact, signs and symptoms, who is at risk, treatment, prevention, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Damaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection. Children with malnutrition or other causes of a weak immune system are at highest risk of death from measles.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nMeasles is one of the world’s most contagious diseases, spread by contact with infected nasal or throat secretions (coughing or sneezing) or breathing the air that was breathed by someone with measles. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. For this reason, it is very infectious, and one person infected by measles can infect nine out of 10 of their unvaccinated close contacts. It can be transmitted by an infected person from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts.\\n\\nMeasles outbreaks can result in severe complications and deaths, especially among young, malnourished children. In countries close to measles elimination, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThere is no specific treatment for measles. Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications.\\n\\nDrinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important.\\n\\nDoctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections.\\n\\nAll children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\\n\\nPrevention', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles', 'title': 'Measles', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on measles providing key fact, signs and symptoms, who is at risk, treatment, prevention, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=\"Doctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections.\\n\\nAll children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nCommunity-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive.\\n\\nChildren should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12–15 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15–18 months.\\n\\nThe measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella.\\n\\nRoutine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$\\xa01 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible.\\n\\nCombining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb.\\n\\nIn 2023, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as not all children develop immunity from the first dose.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles', 'title': 'Measles', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on measles providing key fact, signs and symptoms, who is at risk, treatment, prevention, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=\"In 2023, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday.

Where children are unvaccinated, outbreaks occur.

Two different clades exist: clade I and clade II\\n\\nCommon symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last 2–4 weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\nMpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with someone who is infectious, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals.\\n\\nLaboratory confirmation of mpox is done by testing skin lesion material by PCR.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox', 'title': 'Mpox (monkeypox)', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on monkeypox: includes key facts, definition, outbreaks, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Common symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last 2–4 weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes.\\n\\nMpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with someone who is infectious, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals.\\n\\nLaboratory confirmation of mpox is done by testing skin lesion material by PCR.\\n\\nMpox is treated with supportive care. Vaccines and therapeutics developed for smallpox and approved for use in some countries can be used for mpox in some circumstances.\\n\\nIn 2022–2023 a global outbreak of mpox was caused by a strain known as clade IIb.\\n\\nMpox can be prevented by avoiding physical contact with someone who has mpox. Vaccination can help prevent infection for people at risk.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nMpox (monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus.

The two genetic clades of the virus are clades I and II.\\n\\nThe monkeypox virus was discovered in Denmark (1958) in monkeys kept for research and the first reported human case of mpox was a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, 1970). Mpox can spread from person to person or occasionally from animals to people. Following eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide, mpox steadily emerged in central, east and west Africa. A global outbreak occurred in 2022–2023. The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown – various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are susceptible.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nPerson-to-person transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or other lesions such as in the mouth or on genitals; this includes contact which is\\n\\nface-to-face (talking or breathing)\\n\\nskin-to-skin (touching or vaginal/anal sex)\\n\\nmouth-to-mouth (kissing)\\n\\nmouth-to-skin contact (oral sex or kissing the skin)\\n\\nrespiratory droplets or short-range aerosols from prolonged close contact\\n\\nThe virus then enters the body through broken skin, mucosal surfaces (e g oral, pharyngeal, ocular, genital, anorectal), or via the respiratory tract.

The mpox rash begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and evolves over 2-4 weeks in stages – macules, papules, vesicles, pustules. Lesions dip in the centre before crusting over. Scabs then fall off. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is a classic feature of mpox. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms.\\n\\nIn the context of the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022 (caused mostly by Clade IIb virus), the illness begins differently in some people.

The first lesion can be in the groin, anus, or in or around the mouth.\\n\\nPeople with mpox can become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia, corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing, vomiting and diarrhoea causing severe dehydration or malnutrition; sepsis (infection of the blood with a widespread inflammatory response in the body), inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis), or death. Persons with immune suppression due to medication or medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death due to mpox. People living with HIV that is not well-controlled or treated more often develop severe disease.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nIdentifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies.

rehabilitation (3).\\n\\nWith ageing populations and increasing rates of obesity and injury, the prevalence of osteoarthritis is expected to continue to increase globally.\\n\\nOsteoarthritis is not an evitable consequence of ageing.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition. It causes pain, swelling and stiffness, affecting a person’s ability to move freely.\\n\\nOsteoarthritis affects the entire joint, including the tissues around it. It is most common in the knees, hips, spine and hands.\\n\\nMany factors can contribute to developing osteoarthritis. Some include a history of joint injury or overuse, older age and being overweight. It affects women more than men.\\n\\nExercise and healthy eating to build strong muscles and keep a healthy weight can reduce symptoms. Surgery to replace joints is used in severe cases to reduce pain and regain mobility.\\n\\nOnce pain and loss of movement function become chronic, people with osteoarthritis often experience restrictions in participating in meaningful activities, decreased well-being, and psychological distress.\\n\\nScope of the problem', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis', 'title': 'Osteoarthritis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on osteoarthritis including signs and symptoms, causes, treatments and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Exercise and healthy eating to build strong muscles and keep a healthy weight can reduce symptoms. Surgery to replace joints is used in severe cases to reduce pain and regain mobility.\\n\\nOnce pain and loss of movement function become chronic, people with osteoarthritis often experience restrictions in participating in meaningful activities, decreased well-being, and psychological distress.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nOsteoarthritis is one of the significant contributors to years lived with disability among the musculoskeletal conditions. As osteoarthritis is more prevalent in older people (about 70% are older than 55), global prevalence is expected to increase with the ageing of populations. The typical onset is in the late 40s to mid-50s, although osteoarthritis may also affect younger people, including athletes and people who sustain joint injury or trauma. About 60% of people living with osteoarthritis are women.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of osteoarthritis include pain, swelling, stiffness and trouble moving the affected joint.\\n\\nAs a consequence of reduced movement, muscles often lose strength and people become less able to perform physical activities.\\n\\nOsteoarthritis can affect any joint but is most common in the knees, hips, spine and small joints in the hands. Muscles and tissue around the joint are often affected.\\n\\nSymptoms can develop slowly or start quickly after an injury or strain. Osteoarthritis is chronic and often progressive, so changes happen gradually over time.\\n\\nIn severe cases, it can make the joint unusable and cause long-term pain. Some people feel pain even when resting.\\n\\nBeing less physically active can lead to other conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes.\\n\\nOsteoarthritis can greatly reduce the quality of life. It makes movement painful and difficult, which can stop people from participating in home, work or social activities. This can lead to mental health impacts, trouble sleeping and problems in relationships.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis', 'title': 'Osteoarthritis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on osteoarthritis including signs and symptoms, causes, treatments and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='In severe cases, it can make the joint unusable and cause long-term pain.

It makes movement painful and difficult, which can stop people from participating in home, work or social activities. This can lead to mental health impacts, trouble sleeping and problems in relationships.\\n\\nCause and risk factors\\n\\nSeveral risk factors are known to increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis:\\n\\ninjury to the joint, e.g. fractures, strains, repeated stress in sport or at work;\\n\\npre-existing joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout;\\n\\nspecific metabolic diseases, such as diabetes;\\n\\nobesity – specifically for hip and knee osteoarthritis – as characterized by metabolic abnormalities, systemic inflammation, and contributing to excessive load on the joints;\\n\\ngenetics;\\n\\nsociodemographic factors (age, female sex).\\n\\nPrevention and control\\n\\nSeveral key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent osteoarthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing overuse of joints (e.g. related to workload), and promoting healthy lifestyles (e.g. regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight) play an important role.\\n\\nTreatment and management\\n\\nManagement of osteoarthritis often involves different health workers, who contribute to a rehabilitative strategy tailored to a person’s needs and preferences.\\n\\nBeing diagnosed early and following a treatment plan is the best way to slow the disease and optimize function.\\n\\nExercise can strengthen the affected muscles and help mobility. Other therapeutic approaches can help the joint to move properly and allow people to continue their daily activities.\\n\\nBraces and other assistive technologies can help people to stay independent when movement becomes more difficult.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis', 'title': 'Osteoarthritis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on osteoarthritis including signs and symptoms, causes, treatments and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Being diagnosed early and following a treatment plan is the best way to slow the disease and optimize function.\\n\\nExercise can strengthen the affected muscles and help mobility. Other therapeutic approaches can help the joint to move properly and allow people to continue their daily activities.\\n\\nBraces and other assistive technologies can help people to stay independent when movement becomes more difficult.\\n\\nMedicines like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed to control pain.\\n\\nJoint replacement surgery can reduce pain, restore movement and improve quality of life for most people with severely affected joints. These surgeries are most commonly performed at the hip and knee.\\n\\nIt is important to stay at a healthy weight. Education and counselling are important to help people manage their symptoms and work-related tasks.\\n\\nMost guidelines suggest that opioid analgesics, glucosamine and visco-supplementation therapies are not effective for osteoarthritis and there is insufficient evidence to suggest stem cell therapy is beneficial.\\n\\nSelf-care\\n\\nSelf-care is an important part of managing osteoarthritis. Education and support can help people learn to cope with the physical and mental effects of osteoarthritis. People with osteoarthritis should speak to a health worker to build a tailored care plan.\\n\\nStaying active and maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce symptoms and the risk of their progression.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nWHO is taking action to extend access to care for people with osteoarthritis in different ways:\\n\\nWHO Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative:\\n\\nThe Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation\\xa0provides information on essential interventions for rehabilitation (including assistive products), and human and material resources for 20 health conditions, including osteoarthritis.\\n\\nUN Decade of Healthy Ageing:\\n\\nWHO recommends a reorientation of health and care systems to promote healthy ageing and address the diverse needs of older persons.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis', 'title': 'Osteoarthritis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on osteoarthritis including signs and symptoms, causes, treatments and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=\"WHO Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative:\\n\\nThe Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation\\xa0provides information on essential interventions for rehabilitation (including assistive products), and human and material resources for 20 health conditions, including osteoarthritis.\\n\\nUN Decade of Healthy Ageing:\\n\\nWHO recommends a reorientation of health and care systems to promote healthy ageing and address the diverse needs of older persons.\\n\\nThe Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE)\\xa0approach promotes the person-centred assessment of the older person to guide the design of personalized, health and social care, including long-term care interventions.

It is common but can be serious if not treated.\\n\\nPeople with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms. The only way to know is to get your blood pressure checked.\\n\\nThings that increase the risk of having high blood pressure include:\\n\\nolder age\\n\\ngenetics\\n\\nbeing overweight or obese\\n\\nnot being physically active\\n\\nhigh-salt diet\\n\\ndrinking too much alcohol\\n\\nLifestyle changes like eating a healthier diet, quitting tobacco and being more active can help lower blood pressure. Some people may still need to take medicines.\\n\\nBlood pressure is written as two numbers. The first (systolic) number represents the pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts or beats. The second (diastolic) number represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between beats.\\n\\nHypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥90 mmHg.\\n\\nRisk factors\\n\\nModifiable risk factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. In addition, there are environmental risk factors for hypertension and associated diseases, where air pollution is the most significant.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension', 'title': 'Hypertension', 'description': 'Hypertension is called a \"silent killer\".

Very high blood pressures can cause\\xa0headaches, blurred vision, chest pain and other symptoms.\\n\\nChecking your blood pressure is the best way to know if you have high blood pressure. If hypertension isn’t treated, it can cause other health conditions like kidney disease, heart disease and stroke.\\n\\nPeople with very high blood pressure (usually 180/120 or higher) can experience symptoms including:\\n\\nsevere headaches\\n\\nchest pain\\n\\ndizziness\\n\\ndifficulty breathing\\n\\nnausea\\n\\nvomiting\\n\\nblurred vision or other vision changes\\n\\nanxiety\\n\\nconfusion\\n\\nbuzzing in the ears\\n\\nnosebleeds\\n\\nabnormal heart rhythm\\n\\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms and a high blood pressure, seek care immediately.\\n\\nThe only way to detect hypertension is to have a health professional measure blood pressure.

They can also go unnoticed by healthcare providers. Untreated, syphilis lasts many years.

People who suspect they may have syphilis should speak to their healthcare provider.\\n\\nThe early stage of syphilis is treated with a benzathine penicillin (BPG) injection. BPG is the first line treatment for syphilis and the only WHO-recommended treatment for pregnant women with syphilis. As second line treatment, doctors may also use doxycycline, ceftriaxone or azithromycin, which are antibiotic medicines.\\n\\nBPG is also used to treat later stages of syphilis, but more doses are required. Doses are usually given once per week for three weeks, including when it is not possible to identify the stage of infection.\\n\\nBPG can prevent syphilis from being passed from a mother to baby. Babies born with syphilis (congenital syphilis), or babies whose mother had untreated syphilis, need to be treated right away to avoid serious health problems.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nIn 2022, WHO estimated that 8 million adults aged 15–49 acquired syphilis globally. \\xa0Some countries that systematically monitor syphilis are showing an important increase in syphilis cases among men who have sex with men, including congenital syphilis.\\n\\nIn 2022, WHO estimated there were 700\\xa0000 congenital syphilis cases globally.

For example, globally, an estimated 7.5% of gay men and other men who have sex with men have syphilis compared to 0.5% of men in the general population (1).\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nSyphilis is transmitted during oral, anal or vaginal sex through contact with infectious lesions, and also during pregnancy through the placenta. Transmission typically occurs during early stages of the disease, i.e., up to 2 years after infection.\\n\\nPossible complications\\n\\nSyphilis and HIV infection\\n\\nSyphilis increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately two-fold, as well as of other STIs, such as gonorrhoea, chlamydia, genital herpes, among others.\\n\\nSevere disease\\n\\nWithout treatment, the tertiary phase of syphilis may lead to several complications decades after infection. At this stage, syphilis can affect multiple organs and systems, including brain, nerves, eyes, liver, heart, blood vessels, bones and joints. Tertiary syphilis can also cause death.\\n\\nNeurosyphilis, ocular syphilis and otosyphilis\\n\\nNeurosyphilis, ocular syphilis and otosyphilis can occur at any stage of the disease.\\n\\nNeurosyphilis can cause strong headache, serious muscular problems and mental health issues, including dementia.\\n\\nOcular syphilis can cause pain in the eye, blurry vision, sensitivity to light or blindness.\\n\\nOtosyphilis affects the person’s hearing and/or balance.\\n\\nCongenital syphilis\\n\\nUntreated syphilis may lead to severe negative consequences, such as stillbirth, neonatal death, prematurity, low birth weight and life-long health problems to the infected infant.\\n\\nMother-to-child transmission of syphilis\\n\\nPrevention', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/syphilis', 'title': 'Syphilis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on syphilis, including overview, symptoms, treatment, prevention and WHO response.

It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.\\n\\nThe infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.\\n\\nSymptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.\\n\\nInfants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.\\n\\nMalaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female\\xa0Anopheles\\xa0mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum\\xa0malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.\\n\\nThere are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species –\\xa0P. falciparum\\xa0and\\xa0P. vivax\\xa0– pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\\n\\nSymptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria', 'title': 'Malaria', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on malaria providing key facts, definition, information on transmission, symptoms, who is at risk, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, insecticide resistance, surveillance, elimination, vaccines and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Symptoms\\n\\nThe most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.\\n\\nSymptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.\\n\\nSymptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important.\\n\\nSome types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk. Severe symptoms include:\\n\\nextreme tiredness and fatigue\\n\\nimpaired consciousness\\n\\nmultiple convulsions\\n\\ndifficulty breathing\\n\\ndark or bloody urine\\n\\njaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin)\\n\\nabnormal bleeding.\\n\\nPeople with severe symptoms should get emergency care right away. Getting treatment early for mild malaria can stop the infection from becoming severe.\\n\\nMalaria infection during pregnancy can also cause premature delivery or delivery of a baby with low birth weight.\\n\\nDisease burden\\n\\nAccording to the latest\\xa0World malaria report,\\xa0there were 249 million cases of malaria in 2022 compared to 244\\xa0million cases in 2021. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 608 000 in 2022 compared to 610\\xa0000 in 2021.\\n\\nThe WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2022 the Region was home to about 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 78% of all malaria deaths in the Region.Four African countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (26.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%) and Mozambique (4.2%).\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.\\n\\nLower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria', 'title': 'Malaria', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on malaria providing key facts, definition, information on transmission, symptoms, who is at risk, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, insecticide resistance, surveillance, elimination, vaccines and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Prevention\\n\\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.\\n\\nLower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:\\n\\nUse mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present\\n\\nUse mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) after dusk\\n\\nUse coils and vaporizers.\\n\\nWear protective clothing.\\n\\nUse window screens.\\n\\nVector control\\n\\nVector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).\\n\\nProgress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among\\xa0Anopheles\\xa0mosquitoes. As described in the latest World malaria report, other threats to ITNs include insufficient access, loss of nets due to the stresses of day-to-day life outpacing replacement, and changing behaviour of mosquitoes, which appear to be biting early before people go to bed and resting outdoors, thereby evading exposure to insecticides.\\n\\nChemoprophylaxis\\n\\nTravellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period.\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapies', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria', 'title': 'Malaria', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on malaria providing key facts, definition, information on transmission, symptoms, who is at risk, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, insecticide resistance, surveillance, elimination, vaccines and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Preventive chemotherapies\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy\\xa0is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.\\n\\nPreventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC),\\xa0seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines.\\n\\nVaccine\\n\\nSince October 2021, WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high\\xa0P. falciparum\\xa0malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M.

WHO is very concerned about reports of partial artemisinin resistance in Africa, confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and, most recently, Tanzania. Regular monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance.\\n\\nFor more on WHO’s work on antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, visit the Mekong Malaria Elimination Programme webpage.

Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required.\\n\\nIn 2022, 34 countries reported fewer than 1000 indigenous cases of the disease, up from just 13 countries in 2000. Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria are eligible to apply for the\\xa0WHO certification of malaria elimination. Since 2015, 12 countries have been certified by the WHO Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives (2015), Sri Lanka (2016), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Paraguay (2018), Uzbekistan (2018), Argentina (2019), Algeria (2019), China (2021), El Salvador (2021), Azerbaijan (2023), Tajikistan (2023) and Belize (2023).\\n\\nCountries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO.\\n\\nSurveillance\\n\\nMalaria surveillance is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of malaria-related data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice. Improved surveillance of malaria cases and deaths helps ministries of health determine which areas or population groups are most affected and enables countries to monitor changing disease patterns. Strong malaria surveillance systems also help countries design effective health interventions and evaluate the impact of their malaria control programmes.\\n\\nWHO response', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria', 'title': 'Malaria', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on malaria providing key facts, definition, information on transmission, symptoms, who is at risk, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, insecticide resistance, surveillance, elimination, vaccines and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='WHO response\\n\\nThe WHO\\xa0Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, updated in 2021, provides a technical framework for all malaria-endemic countries.

HIV.\\n\\nThere is no cure for HIV infection. However, with access to effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, including for opportunistic infections, HIV infection has become a manageable chronic health condition, enabling people living with HIV to lead long and healthy lives.\\n\\nWHO, the Global Fund and UNAIDS all have global HIV strategies that are aligned with the SDG target 3.3 of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030.\\n\\nBy 2025, 95% of all people living with HIV should have a diagnosis, 95% of whom should be taking lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, and 95% of people living with HIV on treatment should achieve a suppressed viral load for the benefit of the person’s health and for reducing onward HIV transmission. In 2023, these percentages were 86%, 89%, and 93% respectively.\\n\\nIn 2023, of all people living with HIV, 86% knew their status, 77% were receiving antiretroviral therapy and 72% had suppressed viral loads.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs at the most advanced stage of infection.\\n\\nHIV targets the body’s white blood cells, weakening the immune system. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis, infections and some cancers.\\n\\nHIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids', 'title': 'HIV and AIDS', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on HIV and AIDS with key facts and information on signs and symptoms, transmission, risk factors, testing and counselling, prevention, treatment and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content=\"HIV targets the body’s white blood cells, weakening the immune system.

It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.\\n\\nHIV can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years.\\n\\nWHO now defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO stage 3 or 4 in adults and adolescents. All children younger than 5 years of age living with HIV are considered to have advanced HIV disease.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nThe symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection.\\n\\nHIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including:\\n\\nfever\\n\\nheadache\\n\\nrash\\n\\nsore throat.\\n\\nThe infection progressively weakens the immune system. This can cause other signs and symptoms:\\n\\nswollen lymph nodes\\n\\nweight loss\\n\\nfever\\n\\ndiarrhoea\\n\\ncough.\\n\\nWithout treatment, people living with HIV infection can also develop severe illnesses:\\n\\ntuberculosis (TB)\\n\\ncryptococcal meningitis\\n\\nsevere bacterial infections\\n\\ncancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma.\\n\\nHIV causes other infections to get worse, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and mpox.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nHIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery. \\xa0People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water.\", metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids', 'title': 'HIV and AIDS', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on HIV and AIDS with key facts and information on signs and symptoms, transmission, risk factors, testing and counselling, prevention, treatment and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='HIV causes other infections to get worse, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and mpox.\\n\\nTransmission\\n\\nHIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions.

Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission.\\n\\nRisk factors\\n\\nBehaviours and conditions that put people at greater risk of contracting HIV include:\\n\\nhaving anal or vaginal sex without a condom;\\n\\nhaving another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis;\\n\\nharmful use of alcohol or drugs in the context of sexual behaviour;\\n\\nsharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, or drug solutions when injecting drugs;\\n\\nreceiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, or tissue transplantation; and\\n\\nmedical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; or accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nHIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. This greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and prevention. People can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves. However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health worker or community worker. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids', 'title': 'HIV and AIDS', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on HIV and AIDS with key facts and information on signs and symptoms, transmission, risk factors, testing and counselling, prevention, treatment and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Most widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called “window period” when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others. People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days.\\n\\nFollowing a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate linkage with treatment and care.\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nHIV is a preventable disease.\\xa0 Reduce the risk of HIV infection by:\\n\\nusing a male or female condom during sex\\n\\nbeing tested for HIV and sexually transmitted infections\\n\\nhaving a voluntary medical male circumcision\\n\\nusing harm reduction services for people who inject and use drugs.\\n\\nDoctors may suggest medicines and medical devices to help prevent HIV infection, including:\\n\\nantiretroviral drugs (ARVs), including oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and long acting products\\n\\ndapivirine vaginal rings\\n\\ninjectable long acting cabotegravir.\\n\\nARVs can also be used to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their children.\\n\\nPeople taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners.

arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects multiple body systems, the joints of hands, wrists, feet, ankles, knees, shoulders and elbows are most often affected (3).\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease that causes inflammation around the body and commonly presents with pain in the joints.\\n\\nUntreated, RA can cause severe damage to the joints and their surrounding tissue. It can lead to heart, lung or nervous system problems.\\n\\nCommon symptoms include chronic pain, stiffness, tenderness, heat and swelling in the joints. RA can make it hard to move and perform daily activities.\\n\\nThe causes of rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. Risk factors include smoking, obesity and exposure to air pollution. Women and older people have a higher risk of developing RA.\\n\\nIf diagnosed timely, symptoms and disease progression can be controlled with pharmacological treatment, and optimal functioning can be maintained through rehabilitation (including the use of assistive products). In cases with severe joint damage, surgical procedures, including joint replacement, may help to restore movement or manage pain, and maintain physical function.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nThe typical onset of the disease occurs in adults in their sixties. Women are two-to-three times more often affected than men. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is higher in industrialized countries, which may be explained by demographics (higher average age), exposures to environmental toxins and lifestyle risk factors, and under-diagnosis in low-and-middle-income countries.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/Rheumatoid-arthritis', 'title': 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on rheumatoid arthritis including signs and symptoms, causes, treatments and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Scope of the problem\\n\\nThe typical onset of the disease occurs in adults in their sixties.

The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is higher in industrialized countries, which may be explained by demographics (higher average age), exposures to environmental toxins and lifestyle risk factors, and under-diagnosis in low-and-middle-income countries.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nRheumatoid arthritis causes inflammation and pain in one or more joints. It can happen in most joints, but it’s most common in the small joints of the hands, wrists and feet.\\n\\nRA is chronic and may worsen over time without treatment. It can lead to severe damage to the joint and surrounding tissue. It can also affect the heart, lung and nervous systems.\\n\\nEarly signs and symptoms:\\n\\npain\\n\\nstiffness\\n\\ntenderness\\n\\nswelling or redness in one or more joints, usually in a symmetrical pattern (e.g., both hands or both feet).\\n\\nThe symptoms can worsen over time and spread to more joints including the knees, elbows or shoulders. RA can make it hard to perform daily activities like writing, holding objects with the hands, walking and climbing stairs.\\n\\nPeople with RA often feel fatigue and general malaise (e.g., fever, poor sleep quality, loss of appetite) and may experience depressive symptoms.\\n\\nPain and difficulty moving can lead to problems with sexual function and intimate relationships. Trouble moving easily can cause lower physical fitness and lead to loss of independence, inability to work, reduced well-being and mental health problems.\\n\\nCauses and risk factors\\n\\nThe specific causes for the disease are still unknown, but several modifiable lifestyle-associated (smoking, obesity) and non-modifiable (genetics, female gender, age) risk factors have been identified.\\n\\nPrevention and control', metadata={'source': 'https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/Rheumatoid-arthritis', 'title': 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'description': 'WHO fact sheet on rheumatoid arthritis including signs and symptoms, causes, treatments and WHO response.', 'language': 'en'}), Document(page_content='Causes and risk factors\\n\\nThe specific causes for the disease are still unknown, but several modifiable lifestyle-associated (smoking, obesity) and non-modifiable (genetics, female gender, age) risk factors have been identified.\\n\\nPrevention and control\\n\\nSeveral key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent rheumatoid arthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing exposure to inhaled silica, dusts and occupational risks, and lifestyle related behaviours (e.g., prevention of/stop smoking, healthy nutrition, physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight, maintaining good dental hygiene) play an important role. Some evidence also suggests breastfeeding may be protective to the mother (4).\\n\\nTreatment and management\\n\\nRheumatoid arthritis is not curable. Management of rheumatoid arthritis often involves different health workers, who contribute to a rehabilitative strategy tailored to a person’s needs and preferences.\\n\\nEarly diagnosis and management can reduce symptoms, slow the disease and prevent disability. In some cases, the disease can go into remission.\\n\\nTherapeutic approaches help to improve and maintain joint mobility and muscle strength, to reduce and cope with pain, and to increase exercise capacity and the ability to perform daily activities.\\n\\nAssistive technologies (e.g., orthosis, assistive products for self-care) help people to protect their joints and to perform meaningful activities independently.\\n\\nMedicines to reduce inflammation, pain and swelling may include:\\n\\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\\n\\nglucocorticoids\\n\\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\\n\\nbiological agents.\\n\\nIn severe cases, orthopaedic surgery can reduce pain and restore movement. Rehabilitation is essential to achieve the best outcomes following surgery.\\n\\nIt is important to keep a healthy lifestyle.

Lifestyle changes are often needed for individuals and their families.\\n\\nEducation and support help people with rheumatoid arthritis to develop strategies to cope with the disease. It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular physical activity and a nutritious diet.\\n\\nWHO response\\n\\nWHO is taking action to extend access to care in rheumatoid arthritis in different ways:\\n\\nWHO Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative:\\n\\nThe Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation provides information on essential interventions for rehabilitation (including assistive products), and human and material resources for 20 health conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis.\\n\\nUN Decade of Healthy Ageing:\\n\\nWHO recommends a reorientation of health and care systems to promote healthy ageing and address the diverse needs of older persons.\\n\\nThe Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) approach promotes the person-centred assessment of the older person to guide the design of personalized, health and social care, including long-term care interventions.

facts\\n\\nGonorrhoea is a preventable and curable sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is primarily transmitted through vaginal, oral or anal sex.\\n\\nIn 2020 there were an estimated 82.4 million new infections among adults globally.\\n\\nMost women with gonorrhoea do not have symptoms, and when they do, vaginal discharge is common, while most men present with discharge from their penis.\\n\\nIf left untreated, gonorrhoea can lead to infertility in both men and women and other sexual and reproductive health complications. It also increases the risk of HIV infection.\\n\\nAntimicrobial resistance to gonorrhoea is a serious and growing problem, rendering many classes of antibiotics as ineffective with the risk of becoming untreatable.\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nGonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by a type of bacteria. It usually spreads through vaginal, oral or anal sex. Gonorrhoea is treatable and curable with antibiotics.\\n\\nMost cases of gonorrhoea can be prevented with regular and correct condom use.\\n\\nGonorrhoea causes different symptoms in women and men. Women often feel no symptoms, but untreated infection can lead to infertility and problems during pregnancy.\\n\\nCommon symptoms in men include pain or burning when urinating, discharge from the penis and sometimes pain in the testes.\\n\\nGonorrhoea can be passed from a pregnant mother to her baby.\\n\\nGonococcal infection increases the risk of getting and spreading HIV.\\n\\nScope of the problem\\n\\nIn 2020, WHO estimated 82.4\\xa0million new infections with N. gonorrhoeae among adults aged 15 to 49 years.

However, the emergence of N. gonorrhoeae resistant to antibiotics are making treatment of gonorrhoea more and more challenging, with the risk of becoming untreatable. Rational use of antibiotics and the development of new ones are critical to decrease this eminent threat.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nGonorrhoea can cause symptoms in the genitals, anus or throat. Men and women may experience different symptoms. Symptoms usually begin 1–14 days after sexual contact with an infected person.\\n\\nIn men, common symptoms include\\n\\na white, yellow or greenish discharge from the penis\\n\\npain or burn when urinating\\n\\npainful or swollen testes.\\n\\nMost women with gonorrhea do not have symptoms or do not notice them. If they occur, they can include\\n\\nvaginal discharge\\n\\npain or burning when urinating\\n\\nvaginal bleeding between periods or during sexual intercourse.\\n\\nAnal infection in women and men can cause\\n\\ndischarge\\n\\nbleeding\\n\\nitchiness\\n\\nsoreness\\n\\npainful bowel movements.\\n\\nThroat infections often have no symptoms. If symptoms occur, they can include redness, pain and sore throat.\\n\\nInfants born to mothers with gonorrhoea may develop an eye infection. This causes redness, pain, soreness, ulcers and tearing.

These effects are important but often not quantifiable.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\nMolecular tests are the gold standard for diagnosing N. gonorrhoeae which can be performed in the laboratory or at the point of care. Rapid diagnostic tests are currently under development.\\n\\nGram stain microscopy is used in some laboratories. However, this method is less sensitive in women with vaginal/cervical discharge as well as for throat and anal infections.\\n\\nIn many primary health care settings where diagnostic capacity for detecting N. gonorrhoeae is not available, a syndromic approach for case management is recommended.\\n\\nSexual history taking and risk assessment are crucial in evaluating a service user before diagnosis.

      "Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. The most common treatment for TB is a combination of antibiotics, usually isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. The duration of treatment can last for six months or more, depending on the type of TB and the patient's response to treatment. It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics to ensure the bacteria are completely eliminated. Additionally, maintaining a healthy diet, rest, and avoiding smoking and alcohol can aid in recovery. If you suspect you have TB, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.\n",
